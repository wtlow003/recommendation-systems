      "Hands down one of the most well crafted, all around outstanding game of this generation. I could write a huge review but I really would rather keep playing. I bought the last of us on release day last year for ps3 and was absolutely blown away. Ive never played a game that gave me tears so many times before. Now the remastered comes out and its like reliving it all over again. Truly astounding acting, story, gameplay and visuals. Naughty dog has found their true calling. If you haven't played this, you really need to. Its an experience I never thought I could get from a videogame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

      "Devil May Cry 1 was labeled as a \"stylish hard action game\" meaning it had a load of high-speed stylish action. Devil May Cry 2 though, was a big disappointment to DMC fans. But now with Devil May Cry 3 coming this winter, the series will redeem itself! The first game introduced us to Dante's world and his half-demonic heritage which I won't talk much about since most fans know all about it; the second continued the story but it didn't have any connection whatsoever to DMC1 except the fact that it had Dante and demons. The third one though, will be linked to the first one since it's a prequel. That's right, a prequel. This is what is known about the game:\\nDMC3 promises to return to its roots of stylish and fast action. The game revolves around the clash between the two sons of Sparda, Vergil and Dante. This prequel to DMC1 will explore both of their roots and explain all those plot holes the first one had. It will explain why and how Vergil and Dante were separated and cover more about their parents' deaths. One dark night, Vergil who is evil, materializes a top a gloomy tower in the city Dante lives in. A man called Arkham invites Dante to his twin brother's tower and then leaves as Dante's office is flooded by demons. In this game, Dante hasn't discovered his full powers yet; so wether or not devil trigger will be available is still unknown. The game will have one of the most jaw-dropping intro sequences ever but nothing like Onimusha 3 but still awesome. But the most attention-grabbing new feature in this new installment of the series is that it'll have four(or more if time permits)different styles: Gunslinger which will make Dante a specialist in firearms, Swordsmaster giving Dante more abilities on melee combat, Trickster allowing Dante to perform tricks like walking up walls and other sorts of interaction with the environment, and finally Royal Guard which specializes in hand-to-hand combat.\\nThat is basically everything that is known about the game. But for full information visit [...] or [...] and make sure to go to [...] to check out the amazing trailer of this game. I can't give this game any stars because it hasn't come out yet, but I put five stars because this game is sure to redeem the series after DMC2's failure!!       1\n",
      "The game was obviously rushed out the door. The actual in-game play is quite good and fun BUT there are two main problems:\\n\\n1) Many missing modes and features as compared to earlier editions (and even compared to the ps3/xbox360 versions!)\\n2) The game-modes are incomplete and un-polished. Comparing to EA's madden 15, you can see how poorly NHL 15 stands in comparison.\\n\\nExamples:\\n1) Practice mode is just one player in shootout, over and over again. In madden they guide you through plays and drills on both offense and defense.\\n2) Ultimate mode has NO progression and you can't play your friends. Playing solo vs the computer has you choosing a team to play against and there is no progression. I haven't tried playing humans yet, so there might be more progression there. Madden 15 had a whole set of progression tiers for the solo made which really adds to the mode\\n3) Be a GM doesn't have drafting at all. Either fantasy or  year-by-year. The mode is basically unfinished without these features.\\n\\n...and you can go on and on and on (as others have in these reviews).\\n\\nDon't support EA by buying this unfinished game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

      "I have been a Logitech mouse fan for a while, but when my 518 finally broke, I was feeling cheap, and decided to try the Redragon based on the costs and reviews.  It is a great purchase.  While, its a bit larger than I expected, it fits in my hand well, has lots of programmable buttons, tracks well, and the buttons have a good feel.  The mouse texture is rough, but you can grip it well, and I got used to it almost immediately.  I would definitely but another.     1\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter for her 13th birthday.  She knew what I would be getting her (after checking out different game options and deciding on this).  She loves playing it.
