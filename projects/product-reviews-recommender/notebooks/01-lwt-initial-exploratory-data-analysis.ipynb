    "##### Criteria Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset should ensure that there are no missing reviews, while also ensuring that reviews are of adequate length in order to build a meaningful profile. Futhermore, we will also need to identify user who may potentially be \"*bot*\" users who are paid to generate good/bad reviews for a variety reason – such as artifically inflating product ranking, demeaning competitors products etc. Hence, these users are not an actual personality that we will like to generate a profile for recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the following criteria must be enforced:\n",
    "1. No null values should be present in `reviewText`, else row will be removed\n",
    "2. Minimum length of review should be at least of 100 characters (e.g. \"*Great product*\", will be removed)\n",
    "3. Remove potential \"bot\" users by identify users through – similar/exact same reviews across different products. As we factor in [`reviewerID`, `asin`, `reviewText`], this ensures that we are not removing user who may just be facing network difficulty resulting in multiple duplication of reviews, but instead we are removing users who are intentionally reusing a same review for multiple products. Regardless of whether such users are legimate, having similar reviews over and over does not built a diverse understanding of such a user and hence, recommendations may be not be adequately provided."

      "I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an \"Amazon\" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.     69\n",

      "I have been a Star Trek fan most of my life. I can honestly say this movie was probably one of the best (If not the best) Treks I've ever seen! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. What's more I can't wait for the sequel! and it looks very likely that their will be a sequel. And with a movie this good, you can't expect anything other than the huge success it's enjoying!\\n\\nThe things that made it great where: The story was fantastic, people who weren't already fans of Trek could really get into it, it wasn't hard to understand, but it was still very intelligent. The music was superb! it gave it a very grand and exciting feeling! The effects where top of the line, and just plain brilliant! The humor gave it a more personal quality, so it didn't feel as stiff as it could have been. And the acting was top-notch. They really hit the nail on the head by picking the unknown Chris Pine to play James Kirk. Not only does he look like William Shatner did when he first started playing Kirk, but his acting was exceptional. And there was Zachary Quinto, he did the part of Spock so much justice, it's hard to see anyone else play him. And there was the surprise appearance of Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) playing Older Spock. He really tied the story together. And not to forget, there was also the wonderful performances of Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, Karl Urban, and Eric Bana. Also the children that played Kid Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) and Kid Spock (Jacob Kogan) gave masterful performances for the short background story parts they where tasked with.\\n\\nSo that is why I say this movie was a triumph in every way! Not just as a Star Trek film but as any film! I give this movie a 10 out if 10! If they'd let me I'd give it a 20 out of 10!!!    4\n",

    "inspect_duplicates(filtered_movie_reviews, 'reviewText', \"I have been a Star Trek fan most of my life. I can honestly say this movie was probably one of the best (If not the best) Treks I've ever seen! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. What's more I can't wait for the sequel! and it looks very likely that their will be a sequel. And with a movie this good, you can't expect anything other than the huge success it's enjoying!\\n\\nThe things that made it great where: The story was fantastic, people who weren't already fans of Trek could really get into it, it wasn't hard to understand, but it was still very intelligent. The music was superb! it gave it a very grand and exciting feeling! The effects where top of the line, and just plain brilliant! The humor gave it a more personal quality, so it didn't feel as stiff as it could have been. And the acting was top-notch. They really hit the nail on the head by picking the unknown Chris Pine to play James Kirk. Not only does he look like William Shatner did when he first started playing Kirk, but his acting was exceptional. And there was Zachary Quinto, he did the part of Spock so much justice, it's hard to see anyone else play him. And there was the surprise appearance of Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) playing Older Spock. He really tied the story together. And not to forget, there was also the wonderful performances of Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, Karl Urban, and Eric Bana. Also the children that played Kid Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) and Kid Spock (Jacob Kogan) gave masterful performances for the short background story parts they where tasked with.\\n\\nSo that is why I say this movie was a triumph in every way! Not just as a Star Trek film but as any film! I give this movie a 10 out if 10! If they'd let me I'd give it a 20 out of 10!!!\")"
