Porsche wasn't a sim, but it struck a perfect balance between a sim and arcade. Motor City Online was also an excellent game that was slightly ahead of it's time. Everyone didn't have access to high speed internet yet so they allowed dial-up user to play which caused allot of lag and probably was the main reason the game didn't take off like it should have. I'm not the best driver but MCO offer several other avenues of game play. I'm an old school mechanic so I love building and modify cars, even setup up a dedicated website where I built and sold custom virtual engines. Even had numerous offers from people wanting to buy my custom engines thinking they were real. The auction was also a great feature, I'd get up at3 amjust to get a better deal on a part or car.

Even if they don't want to re-code the entire games, just patch it to run on modern OSes like Win 8 and up (Linux too)Not sure if EA owned Grand Prix Ledgends but it was other excellent game, but it leaned pretty heavy towards a sim. Nascar Racing 2001 by Papyrus stayed in High demand for years, EA bought it, changed the physics and ruined it. Need to re-do it and put the physics back to what everyone liked.

However that\\'s to be expected the late 90\\'s versus the beginning of the second decade of the twenty first century.\\n\\nThere have been some complaints as to the older version games not being able to play on newer OS, that would be incorrect.\\nWe have OS\\'s Windows: XP, Vista and 7; we have Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill (original), Stay Tuned for Danger, Message in a Haunted Mansion plus almost the rest of the Nancy Drew PC line running on these OS\\'s.\\n\\nIf you computer\\'s OS isn\\'t smart enough to switch over to the formats for you you can try the following instructions below; otherwise the game will install, but will not play because it was intended to run a much larger file in a much smaller window (I know that doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense, but it is correct in the way I explained it).\\n\\nThis is what you need to do if you have a newer computer/OS (Windows: XP, Vista, 7, 8) and you are trying to play this older model game: You need to first install the game. It will do a computer anaylisis and will tell you that your computer \"Fails\" under two categories 1.) Color Resolution and 2.) OS (Operating System), ignore and install the game anyway. If you click to play the game after the install and an \"Error\" message appears close it and manually change your computer\\'s compatibility mode.\\n\\nTo set your computer to run in Compatibility Mode: This can be accessed from the Control Panel; just type in \"Older Version\" in the Control Panel Search Bar and the link will show up. Click it. A Dialog box will pop up and ask which version of Windows you would like to run this program in, choose either Windows: 95, 98 or ME.\\n\\nThe computer should ask you if you wish to save this profile for every time you use this particular program click \"Yes\" or \"Apply\".\\n\\nAlso from the Control Panel or by Right Clicking on your Desktop under \"Screen Resolution\" switch your pixel resolution all the way down to 800x600.\\n\\nIf for some reason you computer does not switch back to normal once you\\'ve ejected the game, then once again, just reset the changes manually. The same goes for the fact, if your computer does not automatically set itself back to an older version of windows and a smaller screen resolution when you play the game again; just do it manually, it literally takes two minutes, both ways.\\n\\nRegardless of how much the graphics may suck, any older model game can play on a newer computer/OS whether it\\'s on a CD-ROM or a Floppy Diskette (as long as you have a USB enabled External Floppy Diskette Drive or you hard wire one into your Desktop).',\n",

The music for the game is also pretty generic. However, you can put your own music into the game that you create if you change the format of the audio file.\\n\\nThe game-play is decent enough. Being able to create your games from scratch is enjoyable. There is a good amount of customization you have when creating your games from the objectives of the level to the rewards for beating it. As you complete certain tasks, you unlock new features which give you much more customization to the various features of the levels.\\n\\nHowever, the mechanics are very limited. After testing out your games, you realize that the games feel very clunky. The controls are some of the worst in video games and there is absolutely no way to change the key bindings. Also, there is nothing really \"tycoon\" about it. You\\'re not making games to sell them and there isn\\'t any business aspect to it.

The Corporatist perspective is to treat you like trash, i.e. calling you names like \"idiot! moron!, etc.\" vs. actually teaching you what you need to know in order to proceed to the next level. There was no real clear indicator regarding how to build or obtain a mission objective unless you have some previous city building experience.\\n\\n$10 I got it for but damn, I regret it.\\n\\nI can\\'t comment multi-player so that\\'s why I gave it 3 stars.',\n",

But, if you\\'ve dabbled in Empire Earth, AOE, Age of Mythology, and enjoy these economy based warfare games, definitely give ANNO 2070 a shot.\\n\\nThere is a learning curve, particularly if you are a newcomer to the series.  Essentially, this game is about meeting the needs (food, drink, belongings, entertainment, community, etc.) of your citizens, which become increasingly demanding as they rise from the ranks of common workman to something equivalent of CEO.  With their progression brings higher taxes income, yielding a stronger economy capable of building and supporting an impressive military.  Warfare is not necessarily the focus, or even the majority of the fun, in this game, but it still gives the option for ship, submarine, and aerial combat, with several units of each type available.  You can even go nuclear.  It\\'s pretty sweet.\\n\\nThere are three \"races\" of people.  It\\'s a bit like Starcraft in that they can each build their own units, and have their own specific needs.  The first group is the ECOS - they are the liberal hippy tree huggers who care only about thee environment, and turn unhappy if the ecobalance becomes too polluted.  The 2nd group, the TYCOONS, are the seal clubbin\\' oil drillin\\' conservatives who care only about making money no matter the cost.  Finally, you have the TECHS, a faction only concerned with technological research.  The TECHS are featured moreso in the expansion (ANNO 2070: Deep Ocean), but are still important for development of ECO and TYCOON needs as they advance.  I highly recommend the expansion if you play this and find you like it - it adds so many new ways to develop your cities.\\n\\nI love this game.  I\\'ve always been a fan of city builders, but this one (like ANNO 1404) has really drawn me in.  I\\'ve put in weeks worth of hours on it and am still playing.  The campaign missions are fun, but the real joy lies in a continuous game.  Once you are comfortable playing, you can spend literally hours on a hard continuous game with 3 AI players, a pirate base, and a warship hellbent on your destruction.  It is still a challenge even after playing for over a year.  I think a lot of what makes it fun is that no two games are ever played the same way.  There are different ways to power your city, different upgrades to utilize, different ways to destroy your opponents.\\n\\nA quick note about DRM: It sucks that this game must be played with a constant internet connection.  There is a multi-player faction, but honestly I\\'ve never even tried it.  Single player is what I enjoy, and there\\'s no reason to be online for that.

You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did.\\nLength of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game.\\nStory - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad.\\nOverall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don\\'t confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay.\\nCharacter dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn\\'t seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There\\'s no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at.\\nHand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn\\'t hard to do hand to hand. It wasn\\'t 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good.\\nCons:\\nOMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn\\'t bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it.\\nGraphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues.\\n(Minor Spoiler) Don\\'t read if you can\\'t take hints.\\nSheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn\\'t believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.\\n\\nProfessional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can\\'t even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons.\\nSniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over.\\nAll in all, it\\'s a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower. Don\\'t waste your $ on the Pro Edition.',\n",

       " \"I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

There is absolutely no relationship to driving this \"car\" to anything in real life, other than when you step on the gas it goes forward.\\n\\nIn actual rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the car; its the defining quality of racing on dirt.  To do that you need to be able to keep the steering wheel straight, and use the brake to shift weight forward and back to control car rotation. But in the game the car is impossible to steer straight going 5mpg on a straight road, let alone hit racing speeds.  I tried every single possible controller setting, and even bought a brand-new wheel. Both had the same problem: turning the wheel 5 degrees results in the steering inputs reacting as if I turned the wheel 10, or 15, or 20, or 30 degrees depending on the speed.\\n\\nThe only workaround I could find was the \"dead zone\", making the wheel inoperable while centered, and then it violently overracts when turned outside of the dead zone.  Using that I could steer straight and then sharply turn, then go straight, then sharply turn.  Ridiculous, yes, but if you watch videos of people driving on youtube.com that\\'s how the game was apparently designed.\\n\\nYou\\'d think that a driver-oriented game would have a multitude of options for the most important aspect of driving: controlling the car.  Instead, the game is horribly slowed down by useless eye-candy graphics and a ridiculously obtuse interface.  Just starting the game and getting to the point of driving a car takes 10 minutes while you frantically hit the enter key trying to tell it to skip the fancy graphics and storyline and get on with the darn game.\\n\\nIf its racing you want then iracing.com is still the only realistic option.

Who knows this review could have been different if I had contacted them, but with the games low price and what came up after google'n the seller. I doubt it.\",\n",
       " 'Pros:\\n\\nThe game is about driving all sorts of vehicles on all different terrain, and at that the game does very well. There are a number of different vehicles to unlock in each vehicle category and the tracks range from asphalt to dirt to snow, some mixing the various terrains in a single course. If anybody has played any of the Colin McRae Rally games, or naturally any of the previous Dirt games, they should feel right at home* (see Cons for *).\\n\\nThe game basically has the player build up his fame to gain more sponsorships and be invited to tournaments and open new seasons. In the first season you are shown all terrains types and give the opportunity to learn gymkhana (~stunt driving~).\\n\\nThe graphics are polished and high quality, especially on the vehicles, and engine audio is up to par.\\nGameplay is fairly straightforward, yet quite entertaining. Smashing your and opponent\\'s vehicles is a ton of fun and damage modeling is well done.\\n\\nIts just fun to drive and crash in the game. The game is very \"modular\" and can be picked up to play for just a short while or you can go all out and spend hours and hours.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nGameplay can get repetitive, and even if the type of event is switched nearly every other race, you get to replay the same tracks, a number of times in different events (which are \"different\" really only by name).\\n\\nCar feel is somewhat bland, most cars in the same group feel very similar or nearly identical, the biggest difference you will feel is the stopping distance increase with more horsepower of the car. By contrast, this also makes it weird when a car actually behaves quite differently than the others, such as Ken Block\\'s car or the Original Mini Cooper.\\n\\nIn conjunction to the above, car handling is a bit weird at times, might be me, using a keyboard, but, during a normal dirt rally stage, you pretty much cannot recover from a real handbrake turn. Not sure if it is because of car tuning or abs still on (abs should not matter, but it\\'s the only thing I have on) but once the car\\'s back-end has slid around past say 20 degrees off center, the slide is irrecoverable. Does not matter if you apply full opposite lock, does not matter if you break, accelerate, or just let go of the gas pedal, does not matter what type of turn it is (shy of a hairpin), your call will keep sliding in the same direction, potentially getting more sideways, until you crash or slow down to 10 km/h (6mp/h).\\n\\nGames for Windows Live - whenever you see this logo, be afraid, very afraid! In Dirt 3, you will HAVE TO have or create a Windows Live account, or you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE THE GAME. Or play online for that matter. This is just some crappy DRM scheme and I was quite sad to find out about it, as this, plus having to always have the dvd in your drive, makes just booting the game an annoyance. Once all is set up, its not that bad of a hassle, but still, why punish players that buy the game?\\n\\nThe menus and animations, and introductions will drive you up a wall. The are cool the first 100 times, -_- , not allowing me a way to skip them is just cruel. You will notice this the most when you enter a race: unskippable animation to show you your car, 1 second pause, menu pops up with \"Race\" and \"Mod car stuff\", etc, and then another 5 second animation to show you your car again, but on the starting grid, 1 second pause, and then its time to race, 3 second countdown till you can actually drive. Also every time you select an item from the race menu (those triangle things) again, animation, 1 second halt, here is what you ordered, oh new selection, sorry that need another animation.\\n\\n* People that were used to the Colin McRae games might be wondering where real rally went in the game. The one with the stages, and having to spend time in between races to repair damage, having to complete a few stages of a race with a half broken car. The special feeling of being part of the WRC is mostly gone. Now most races are on the short side (they do get longer as you progress), can be restarted at any point and no previous-race progress is lost, and even more there is the rewind feature. Naturally you do not need to use these mechanics, but just being there spoils the mood.\\n\\nOther Thoughts:\\n\\nIt may seem like I slammed the game pretty hard, but then gave it a strangely high mark. The point is that the game is good, quite good, despite all the above issues, which all in all are actually fairly small things. Plus the cheap price bumps it up a notch.\\n\\nYou will want to immediately turn off all assists (keep the driving line and abs at first, then decide for yourself) else the car basically drives itself.\\n\\nThe loss of a true rally mode may be a make it or break it deal for somebody. The game is really fun, the driving is very fun regardless of the issues stated above, yet you will miss good ol\\' Colin.\\nI would have given the game 3.5 out of 5, just because of the great stuff lost over the years, but I realized that it was not fair to compare it with something that (unfortunately) it is not anymore.\\n\\nFor $12 it\\'s a great deal.',\n",

In fact, you can modify the database to unlock all the cars, all the races. Just google \"dirt 3 unlock mod.\"  The file is a replacement for \"database.bin\" - so all you have to do is search for that file, save the original file as backup and replace it with the unlocked database.

The career mode is lame in that they make you do all sorts of challenges like spinning your car and making it skid, and then different styles of racing (rally, tarmak, race with others on dirt) with lame cars. If you like one particular style of racing, you are really forced to do all styles so it gets old.\\n\\nI must say, the driving engine is good, but the game is just boring and doesnt entice me to keep playing.

       " \"In today's game market it's easy to miss racing games that aren't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises. Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.\\n\\nThis is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.\\n\\nPROS:\\n-Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects\\n-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive\\n-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling\\n-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins\\n-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea)\\n-3D support!\\n\\nCONS:\\n-Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard\\n-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)\\n-Essentially requires some sort of analog input\\n-May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing\\n\\nOther thoughts:\\n-You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy!\\n-LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks.\\n-If you want to win, employ a Fin!\",\n",

       " 'I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.\\nI was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.\\nIt is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case.\\nI am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu\\'s , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it.

How? By using Microsoft Virtual PC and Windows 98. (NOT Windows XP Mode unless your have a high-end version of Windows).

Next, make sure you\\'ve installed Virtual Machine Additions, and enable hard drive sharing. That allows you to access the physical hard drives on your that you tell Virtual PC to share in the settings. Next, put your YDKJ CD or ISO image in, capture the drive, (this trick works with any Jack game save for 5th Dementia...you\\'ll just have to install and play that one on the virtual machine), install the game, then copy the entire contents of the Jack CD (save for the setup files), overwrite anything and everything, then try running the game without the CD. If it runs, then copy the game\\'s folder on to your computer\\'s physical hard drive. Then in your newer Windows system, make sure that you apply the 640x480 resolution compatitbilty setting to the game. That prevents the game from being a tiny window in the middle of the screen.

Instead of the kind, warm, and friendly voice of an Alex Trebek or Regis Philbin, the host of  \"You Don\\'t Know Jack\" is more reminiscent of  Anne Robinson from THE WEAKEST LINK with his sarcastic comments and snide asides.  It makes for a fun, entertaining, and educational experience.  This is the YOU DON\\'T KNOW JACK MOVIES and the questions all have something to do about film.  Don\\'t be fooled by the playfulness and multiple-choice options, some of these questions are extremely difficult to get, even if your mind is a walking encyclopedia of film knowledge.  The game can be played in two different formats: a seven question round and a twenty-one question round.  The seven question format takes about fifteen minutes to play while the longer version takes almost forty-five.  Most of the questions are in multiple choice, but there are different types:  picture questions, fill in the blanks, whatshisname questions, gibberish questions, dis or dat choices, and the final round of the game is called Jack Attack (an association question).  I\\'ve found the gibberish questions the most difficult because it takes me a little longer to remember movies that sound like what appears on the screen.  Also, if you play the game with more than one person there is a \"screw your neighbor round\" where you can force someone else to answer a question instead of yourself.

However, there is a ***free*** program called Exult that will allow you to play Ultima 7 on new versions of Windows, including Vista and Windows 7. But you *must* have Ultima 7 installed for it to work, because it has to access the game files, so you do have to own this game already to play.

Going back about 15 years, I\\'d seen my friend play Ultima 4 and Ultima 6 at his house before and thought they looked okay, but it wasn\\'t until I played Ultima 7 that I really \"got\" it. Ultima 7--the Complete Ultima 7--is simply epic in every sense. You start out transporting into the town of Trinsic in Britannia, where your old pal Iolo is waiting and informs you that a ritualistic double murder has occurred in town, and your first task by order of the mayor of Trinsic is to investigate the crime scene, interview the townsfolk, and report back to him with your findings. So begins one of the most epic video games you will ever play.\\n\\nFrom there you will begin interviewing townsfolk, learn about recent events and attacks on the town, and begin learning about a religious organization called The Fellowship that seems to have taken Britannia by storm with its influence. The organization appears to have good intentions, but appearances can be deceiving, and it isn\\'t long before you are tasked by Lord British with joining The Fellowship so you can further investigate what goes on behind the scenes with The Fellowship and its charismatic, enigmatic, and inexplicably sinister leader, Batlin. And maybe figure out what the deal is with that big red face, otherwise known as The Guardian, who occasionally pops up on your screen and taunts you while you\\'re playing. And as you suspect, not all is what it seems with The Fellowship, and it is up to you to rescue Britannia from the threats within.\\n\\nAlong the way you will spend innumerable hours taking in the ENORMOUS, living, breathing world of Britannia that Origin created. You will meet many companions for your party, some new and some old, and forge relationships with them through the clever, witty, and well-written dialog.  You will meet the huge populace of the world, detailed to the extent that they all have their own houses, their own jobs, their own lives, and if you stand around and watch, you can see them engaging in all three over the course of each day. No, you won\\'t just see people in their shops 24/7 while you walk around on your quest. The people of Britannia will wake up in the morning, go to work, go to the local pub, come home and relax, and then sleep. They each have their own possessions, most of which you can take unless they have a locked chest and a hidden key. But going with the moral themes of the Ultima series, stealing items in front of other people will not only cause them to call the town guards on you, but steal enough and your companions will tell you they don\\'t agree with your morality anymore and they will leave you. Each town in Britannia is fully realized, with homes, pubs, shops, religious centers, and sometimes entertainment (such as the theater in Britain). Origin has also elected to give you the opportunity to participate in these enterprises. That\\'s right, if you\\'d like you can take a job with the baker in Britain and help him make loaf after loaf of fresh bread by literally mixing flour with water, rolling out the dough, putting it in the oven, and retrieving it. That is how ridiculously detailed Ultima 7 is. The world is big enough that you can easily get lost in the forest, mountains, or swamp if you stray from the dirt roads. However, this is often where you will run into the little hidden gems of Ultima 7, the random occurrences and hidden areas that you wouldn\\'t normally find. It is either in Part 1 or Part 2 where you may run into a lone house in the middle of the forest with a computer inside playing Ultima 8 and a dead pirate lying on the ground. If you click the computer either Iolo or Shamino say, with typical Ultima sarcasm, \"Ultima 8? Sounds about right, I\\'d say.\"\\n\\nAnd that is just Ultima 7 Part 1. Ultima 7 Part 2 takes place after the events of Part 1, thrusting you into the Serpent Isle with only Shamino, Dupre, and Iolo as company, and lucky you, as soon as you touch down a lightning teleportation storm hits and teleports all three companions elsewhere, leaving you alone. Your first order of business is to begin finding your friends and to continue chasing the villains from Part 1 (I don\\'t want to give away too much). But Serpent Isle has its own deal going on. The first city you encounter, Monitor, is a city of warriors; the only way to gain their trust and get them to actually help you is to pass their test of knighthood and become one of them. As you progress through Part 2, you will take on many more quests, meeting many more people and discovering many more plots in places like Fawn, the city of beauty, and Moonshade, a city full of mages. The core gameplay of Part 2 is the same as Part 1 and has the same sorts of cool stuff as I listed above. The graphics engine was updated a bit between Part 1 and Part 2, but not enormously.\\n\\nFinally, there are the two expansions to round out the package: the Forge of Virtue for Part 1 and the Silver Seed for Part 2. These are not integral to completing either game, but add a little more to the storyline and your experience in the game. You can ignore them if you choose. It really doesn\\'t matter.\\n\\nBottom line: whether you are seeing Ultima 7 here as the Complete Ultima 7 or in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ultima-Collection/dp/B000028U20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ultima Collection</a>, it is more than worth your time. It is, as I said, the greatest game I have ever played, lovingly detailed to the most minute factor and easily addicting through its sheer vastness. This game will suck hours and hours out of your life, but at the end of it you will be glad you invested the time, because the gameplay will stick with you long after the Avatar saves the day yet again.',\n",

I saw this set online and just knew i had to have this! Not only do i have a game guide collection, but i have a separate collection just for Zelda! So this was literally the best of both worlds for me! The bookmark is very cool and the \"chest\" box is a nice storing unit for the books. The books are beautiful! The gold lining on the pages, and the cover of each book is different and gorgeous.  The letter of authenticity is just so exciting!

Something else I love is that each book has designs specific to the game that they represent (like the OoT book has little gold Ocarinas and Shiek's harp in the corners on the front cover). I didn't pay full price for them since I got them during a sale but I certainly would pay  full price for them.\",\n",

Some of the guides in it I never saw released (Twilight Princess) and I wonder how I missed them. Great buy for the just over $100 I paid. A lot of the guides by themselves are selling $40-50 ea.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m not one to write a review, but I felt compelled to write one for this to help give people an idea of what to expect. I am an avid Zelda fan and a collector to a lesser extent. I have bought the hard cover collector\\'s edition Prima Guide for Zelda as far back as Twilight Princess and gotten nearly every one since.\\n\\nI had 4 of these books already, and 2 paperback books of the other 2 guides. So in a way I was buying a set of books I already had. Still has a collector and a fan, I could not pass it up and for me, I could not be happier I got this.\\n\\nIn reading some other reviews about this item, I hope to clarify a few things about this set.\\n\\n1. First off, I will say that my original set did come with a damaged chest. I got a replacement from Amazon, so no biggie and I\\'m not going to ding a star off for that. It was just bad packaging.\\n\\n2. The metal book mark is fantastic, and better than I expected. The chest is nice and having the ribbon inside to help pull out the first book is a nice touch. Note it\\'s meant to just pull out ONE book at the back, which if you keep them in order should be Wind Waker HD.\\n\\n3. As noted, this set does not come with the extra items such as cloth maps that the original individual books came with. Not a big deal to me, but it is what it is. What it does come with, and just that this set is a limited edition makes up for it to me.\\n\\n4. I want to give a breakdown of these books and how they compare to the original individual ones I have, where applicable.\\n\\n- The Phantom Hourglass Guide is identical to the original lone book.\\n\\n- The Twilight Princess Guide IS The revised guide that apparently came out in 2007. I got my original when Twilight Princess came out and didn\\'t even know till I read the other reviews on here that there even was a revised edition. The 16 or so new pages are mostly a greatly expanded and more detailed \"legendary checklist\" at the back of the book.\\n\\n- Spirit Tracks: This one through me for a bit because the book in the set is about 1/4 an inch thicker than my original, but the contents and number of pages are identical so they must be using thicker paper. The only difference that I noticed is that the table of contents is the very last page of the book. I am honestly not sure if that is an error or intentional.\\n\\n- Ocarina of Time 3D. One of the books exclusive to this set and never available as a hard cover on it\\'s own. This is a very nice book and one of the reasons I wanted this book. In comparing in to my paper back version, the contents are the same but the page layouts are different here and there.\\n\\n- Skyward Sword. I did not get this one originally in hard cover, which was available on it\\'s own. But I have read and discovered it\\'s a greatly changed book from the original. It say it\\'s revised and expanded by over 100 pages, but in reading on Prima\\'s website the making of this set, they go into detail about how this book was basically rewritten by a new author and has all new screen shots. It\\'s much more than just expanded by 100 pages. This was my biggest surprise in this set, as I thought the Ocarina of Time book would be the only really unique book in this set, but it\\'s really that one and this one.\\n\\n- The Wind Waker HD. This book came out individually very recently so naturally the one in this set is identical to the stand alone.\\n\\nAnd that is about it. Like a said, a very great set and I am thrilled to own it.',\n",
       " \"This is a really nice collection, a must have for all Zelda fans. It just has some little details I didn't like: 1) My Ocarina of Time 3D guide is backwards, like they messed up when they bound the cover. It doesn't make it useless but it feels weird. 2) Why didn't they include space for the Link between worlds guide? It's a shame my copy of that guie has to be outside the chest. Everything else is great.\",\n",

Not only does it include 6 limited edition strategy guides with bonus content not available anywhere else, but it also comes with a beautiful golden etched bookmark and a certificate of authenticity with the limited number and message from the producer of the game. Each book ends up being about 20 dollars so the fact that it's all a limited release, the price is definitely worth it!\\n\\nAs a Zelda fan, I would definitely recommend fans to go out and spend the money because you'll be sorry if you don't!

I was without a doubt worthy of 5 stars, that is until I look more closely. At first, I had only taken out the Wind Waker HD and spent 15 minutes preparing the spine for reading. When I was finished, I took out the next guide, Skyward Sword, and immediately saw a scratch on the upper backside of the spine. Upon further observations, I noticed that there were small dents near the bottom of the spine and even what appears to be some hot glue coming from the bottom of the binding.

If you wanted the extras, you should buy the original version of the CE guide. The metal bookmark that comes with these guides looks beautiful though it had a couple very small blemishes on the surface of one side. Magnetic lid closes nicely.

It\\'s not sewn and it\\'s a \\'perfect binding\\' which is the least reliable of the sort. Pages will fall out with light use as has been the case with many, many books with this type of binding.\\n-General scuffs around the books and bookmark - not up to \\'collector\\' standard, a lot of tiny scuffs here and there on all items inside.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n-The box (chest) feels very good, much better than other cardboard box sets. It feels nice and rigid for what it is. No problems there.\\n-The game guides themselves provide great amount of content\\n-The bookmark, besides the few little scuffs, is fantastic. Really nice.\\n\\nAll in all, the binding is the biggest deal breaker for me. It is basically just a paperback glued to a hardcover and provides no real advantage over paperbacks. Pages falling out with ease is not my definition of a collector\\'s set and definitely would not pay the asking price for it.',\n",

It is glossy and serves its purpose well.  The chest is handy for holding all these guides, and serves as a nice showpiece.

The hardcover guides are beautiful with gilded edges and he certificate of authenticity is nicely tucked away in an envelope.

None of the bonus maps/posters/bookmarks that originally came with the Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, or Spirit Tracks guides are included.\\n\\n2. One highly usual thing is that the Twilight Princess guide is a reprint of the original one from 2006 and not the revised edition from 2007 which had 16 more pages of expanded content.  Seems like a really weird move to not have used that revised edition for this boxset.\\n\\n3. And finally, why no space for the Link Between Worlds guide?  Would have been great since that came out at the same time.',\n",
       " \"I  cannot express to you how happy I am to have received such an amazing box set. The Legend of Zelda has always been a very special franchise to me, and I could not pass the opportunity up when I saw this item. I really cannot say much more than the other 5-star reviews already have, but wow, what a great steal. BUY THESE BOOKS NOW. Seriously, right now. The price listed here on Amazon is unbeatable, and the prices will surely go up. I paid just shy of $18 for each book considering the total price I ended up paying (oh yeah, and free shipping). This is BEFORE all of the other features of the set, such as the sturdy bookmark, certificate of authenticity, and chest container. I think it is very well worth it by all standards.\\nNow, my set had only a few minor flaws that I felt should be pointed out but do not subtract my overall score because they are, as I mentioned, relatively minor. My bookmark has several small scratches on the back of it that I had noticed directly after I had pulled it out. It's a shame... It's quite a nice looking bookmark. Another thing to note is the fact that some of the golden gilded pages were not entirely, well, gilded. There were a few spots on various books that had tiny amounts of the golden paint missing. Where it is lacking, the edges look slightly darker than the surrounding area. Overall, just a tad bit disappointing, but nothing that will make me disregard the amazing features of the entire set.\\nI love these game guides and hope to find ones more like them in the future.\",\n",
       " \"Great set for any Zelda fan.\\nAlthough I am sad that the maps that came with the first prints weren't included it is still fantastic set!\",\n",
       " \"This collection is OUTSTANDING in terms of quality and appearance.  Over the years, I have purchased most of these guides and got the additional materials that were included with them (though these were not replicated for the guides in this collection unfortunately).  If ever you were looking for a nice collection of books concerning The Legend of Zelda or to aid in completing the games, this set is DEFINITELY for you.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\n1)  Quality:  The outer box resembles a treasure chest, the likes of which Link finds all across Hyrule (and many other worlds connected to it).  It is a sturdy cardboard coated with a gloss-like finish, and it seems to have a magnetic clasp built in to keep the top closed.  On the roof of the top, when opened, is a slot containing a metallic (yes, metallic, not vinyl or cardboard) bookmark that has been beautifully etched by what appears to be laser.  It contains the logo of the series on one side and the crest of the Royal Family of Hyrule on the other, making for a very attractive (and unexpectedly greater quality) bookmark.  The books themselves all appear to be of slightly better quality than their original prints (which had binding problems and easily tore in some instances).\\n\\n2)  Additional Goodies:  The most obvious additional item (and most sought after in time I am sure) would be the guide for Ocarina of Time 3D, which is only available through this set (of which only 50,000 exist).  I have examined it, and it is a VERY nice guide for the game, and as beautifully put together as its companion guides.  Another obvious extra is the metallic bookmark, which is really one of the nicest bookmarks I have seen honestly.  Also, something else extra that may be easy to miss is this:  some of the materials in this print of the guides have been expanded upon (the number of pages in Skyward Sword's guide has increased by 100 if that tells you anything).\\n\\n3)  Collectible Status:  The set comes with a certificate of authenticity that includes a stamped number out of 50,000 and with the printed message and signature of Eiji Aonuma.  It marks the set as one out of 50,000 which indicates its collectible status and will almost certainly indicate an increase in value as time goes on.\\n\\n4)  Packaging:  I have NEVER seen such good packaging for any item I have bought online as I have for this one.  The box the collection was shipped in is a good middle size containing two foam-like holding pieces that fit onto each end of the chest/box which hold it in place (and suspend it both above the shipping box's bottom and below the shipping box's top) and ensures that the package will not move around inside the shipping box at all during transport.  I intend to keep the shipping box and packaging the collection came in to transport it again when I am ready to move.  You can definitely rest assured that the collection will not suffer damage during shipping.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n1)  Lack of Previous Additional Materials:  As indicated before, the previous materials included with the previous print of these guides were not included, nor the map from the recently released Wind Waker HD guide.  This is a small complaint, as Twilight Princess's guide originally came with a cloth map of Hyrule, the Phantom Hourglass guide came with a vinyl bookmark of its own, and the Spirit Tracks guide originally came with a printed map of Hyrule.  While this is a regrettable exclusion, one should also take note that those materials were fairly cheaply made.  Hence, you're not missing out on much in that regard.\\n\\n2)  Exclusion of ALBW Guide:  It is a shame that the makers of the collection did not have the foresight to include the recently released collector's guide for A Link Between Worlds in this collection, and considering they came out basically at the same time they easily could have.  This is a minor complaint, as the guide for A Link Between Worlds is of course available for purchase and comes with a collector's lithograph of the primary image from A Link Between Worlds.  Still, it would have been nice to have gotten them all together in one fell swoop, though of course this would have increased the size and weight of the package even more than it already is (and trust me, it weighs a good amount).\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  This is an AWESOME set that will make any collector ecstatic to possess for not only its vast wealth of knowledge concerning the games it covers, but also for its beauty, craftsmanship and quality.  If you have not already gotten these guides, I STRONGLY encourage you to pick up this set while you are able to (there are only 50,000 in existence).  And if you have already gotten some of these guides as I had, I encourage you to still pick up this set and possibly sell your older copies as I plan to.  I plan to keep the extras that came with the previous printings of the guides and sell the guides themselves, as I now have this collection and no longer have any need for them.  The mere inclusion of the Ocarina of Time 3D guide (which apparently is not going to be released outside this set according to the publishers) alone should be a pretty good reason to get this collection, and after seeing it in person, I couldn't agree more that it was indeed worth it.\",\n",
       " 'Just got my set today and it is wonderful! The magnetic chest looks very nice, and the metallic bookmark is gorgeous! The gilded pages are beautiful and I love the hylian symbol on the front. The only defect (for me anyway) is the spirit tracks guide. The cover was either bound wrong to the pages, the pages were bound wrong to the cover, or the gold details on the front were put upside down - as when you hold the guide upright or what should be the \"upside\" based on the hylian symbol, the pages are upside-down and facing to the right! I still love the set though and the others are fine. But it is weird opening the guide and having either the pages or the hylian symbol upside down lol',\n",

The books separately are at least $30 each.\\nThis is a perfect LoZ collectors item.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.\\n\\nMy only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.\\n\\nI really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.\",\n",
       " 'this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!',\n",
       " \"This is an amazing edition to and Zelda fan's collection. I don't understand why they didn't either a)leave a spot for the link between worlds guide or b)include it in the bundle. Especially since it was released at the same time as the game\",\n",
       " \"JUST AMAZING! I didn't expect each guide to come with the special maps or extras that went with them on the original prints. I just knew I was getting guides, a fancy bookmark and fancy box. This is the set for the die hard. I'm super excited and glad I purchased this!\",\n",
       " \"In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.\\n\\nBefore I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.\\n\\nTo begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.\\n\\nThere are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.\\n\\nThe second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.\\n\\nThere are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.\\n\\nThe set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.\\n\\nNevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.\",\n",
       " \"I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging.\\n\\nAs other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape.\\n\\nThe guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.\\n\\nI do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included.\\n\\nFirst, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set.\\n\\nSecond, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration.\\n\\nThird (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)\\n\\nFinally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies.\\n\\nOverall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!\",\n",

       " 'Every now and again, a simulation comes along that commands respect by delivering variable degrees of realism coupled with really good AI (Artificial Intelligence) and lots of replayability. Aces Of The Deep is one of them.  More than 10 years after its release, I find myself returning to it again and again, and I never seem to tire of it.\\n\\n Why?  Well, AOTD is blessed with a good design...good graphics for its time (640x480x256 colors), good AI, an easy-to-use interface, and very few bugs.  Nothing ruins your gaming fun like having it crash just as you\\'re whipping your AI opponent\\'s butt, but this has never been much of a problem with AOTD.\\n\\n Speaking of the AI opponent, the AI in this game, at the higher \"realism\" levels, is good enough to hunt you down and depth-charge you to pieces.  Still, I find enemy destroyers are vulnerable to down-the-throat torpedo shots.  It\\'s a good tactic to practice and it has saved my butt many times.\\n\\n Aces Of The Deep is very historically accurate.  When the war starts, you are Kapitain of a slow & weak Type-II sub.  As the war progresses and you & your crew gain experience & survive patrols, more powerful sub designs and better torpedoes become available.  Also, as the war progresses, the Allied sub-hunters  (surface ships and planes) get better and better at hunting you down and sending you plunging to Davey Jones Locker.\\n\\n The first version of Aces Of The Deep was the DOS/Diskette version. An expansion disk was later released which added the Mediterranean Sea theatre and also patched several known bugs.\\n\\n The \"Command\" version -- \"Aces Of The Deep: Command\" -- is CD-based and runs natively on Win95/98.  AOTD Command includes both  the orignal AOTD missions as well as the expansion/add-on missions, it rubs smoother and crashes less than the DOS version, AND it includes voice-recognition, which allows the player to use a microphone to command his U-Boat crew.\\n\\n Whichever version of AOTD you buy, I guarantee that you\\'re in for quite a gaming experience, playing a deadly game of cat & mouse under the cold, unforgiving waves of the North Atlantic.

       " \"First of all- why is this under books? Last time I looked it was a computer game, and a pretty good one as well. The plot is unoriginal- humans create super intellegent cyborgs to fight for us, but they turn against us. Thi is where you, as an expert fighter, come in.\\nThe game sees you driving and flying armored robots in an effort to save the world. There is a range of types of missions. Sometimes it is to defend a base against an attack, on other occasions it is to guard a particualr strategic site or a HERC holding a particular technology advance, all of which should be familiar if oyu've played this type of gaem before.

Every game is a bit different than the last, and special features include rats and skeletons that you can smash with your balls, gargoyles that will pick them up and deposit them elsewhere on the table, and wraiths and vortexes that will eat them. A non-stop-fun pinball simulator.',\n",

       " \"The Editor in Chief A1 software is based on the workbook of the same name. Each lesson includes a short newspaper-style article, and it's up to the player to locate and identify all the grammatical errors the article contains. Unlike the workbook, in which one must identify only where errors are present and how to solve them, the software adds an extra step: You must actually identify precisely what the error is by choosing a description of the flaw from a wide variety of specific categories within the arenas of punctuation, sentence structure, grammar, parts of speech, and the like. (i.e., is the problem that the wrong verb tense was used? Was it an incomplete sentence? Was such-and-such punctuation/word used in the wrong place? Was there an excess of commas or too few? and many other specific descriptions.)\\n\\nIt can be frustrating when you know where an error is, but can't figure out what specific category to place it in. Some kids will take in in stride, but others are prone to get quite annoyed. If this is the case, you may want to look at the lesson with your child and help them through the process of categorizing the error.\\n\\nWhen you finish a lesson, you can play a spelling game where you shoot words with a pencil. Not exactly insanely fun, but a refreshing break, and it's nice that it's still semi-educational.\\n\\nOverall, if you're teaching grammar for approximately Grades 4-5, Editor in Chief A1 is a good choice. It's challenging, more engaging than a workbook, but definitely a strictly educational program; not swamped with fun, games and animation, but nonetheless pleasant to use.\",\n",

The whole point is that you're racing a car and trying to beat other computer controlled cars around the track. With the skin conductance and heart rate monitor (which attaches to your fingertips) you control the car's speed. You increase your speed by slowing down your breathing, heart rate, and skin conductance and getting into a meditative state. Yet the faster you make your car go the louder the music becomes and the more exciting the games gets (i.e. the competition with other cars and drive to achieve the goal of finishing the race increases). And thus the better you do at racing the car the harder it gets to increase its speed due to the increasing difficulty of relaxing. This is directly applicable to test anxiety which is aided by learning to relax even in stressful situations.\\n\\nHowever, if you are new to biofeedback (or don't have a lot of practice) consider starting with a program such as Healing Rhythms first. Dual Drive Pro is VERY challenging and takes practice before you can succeed. It may be discouraging at first, which isn't ideal when learning relaxation. Part of the difficulty though is also part of the appeal as the game is incredibly sensitive and gives almost instant feedback on the slightest increase in tension or excitation. It's fun.\",\n",

       " \"This game was never really a fan favourite. I can see why, but it's also clear to me why it was one of my cherished games as a late teen. The collective of writers, graphic artists and composer(s) in Bloodnet are nothing short of brilliant when it comes to setting a particular mood. I would label this unique mood as urban-dystopian-futuristic-cyberpunk-gothic-mystic that ends up being both oppressive and enchanting at the same time, quite a feat. It's amazing what Microprose can bring out of the dedicated player with little more than a mixture of pre-rendered and handdrawn futuristic stills and peculiar midi music to match. Especially back as a teen, Bloodnet's distinctive atmosphere engulfed my very spirits and managed to linger around me even when I was not actually playing it. Few games (or movies, or books) are capable of this as it takes a certain kind of giftedness, one that this staff happened to possess. VTM: Bloodlines comes to mind, and a couple of others.\\n\\nI also like the fact that Bloodnet is a game of alloys: alloying classic adventure with RPG, distant future with Medieval vampire myths, a bright and loud metropolis with a dark and silent mystery, a detailed and possible future with implausible supernatural goings-on. This aspect was accomplished well.\\n\\nOn the bad side, the game feels like it is not interested in letting us actually play it, but only showing off its great graphics, ambient music and, above all, writing. At the same time, it has high ambitions of attempting to merge the genres of point-and-click adventure and strictly stat-based RPG. The end result is a weird mishmash of endless conversations, heavy turn-based combat, and wandering about on motionless landscapes. Weirdness can be a good and a bad thing, and in this case it's both. Part of the appeal, I think (at least for me).\\nMy biggest beef with the overall experience is the pre-scripted, absolutely non-interactive dialogs. Again, the sprawling, gritty conversations in this game are masterfully written and are more memorable than the ones in most big-time movies I've seen, but leaving them non-interactive is the biggest deal-breaker, a missed chance for an additional layer of depth and player involvement.\\n\\nBloodnet is not a good game. It feels static and almost non-interactive. It is, however, a good experience. So good that it ended up as one of the very few games from the early 90's that I actively revisit from time to time. The ultimate praise I can give the game, I think, is that it is a spiritual and atmospheric precursor to the Deus Ex series and VTM: Bloodlines, which are of course much better games, but Bloodnet holds its own against them in terms of mood, writing and originality. No small feat for a 1993 DOS game.\",\n",

The philosophy behind this system says that while roleplaying may have evolved from 1970s tabletop miniatures wargaming, roleplaying rules shouldn\\'t always play like a Napoleonic battlegame with roleplaying elements grafted on. FATE\\'s ethic eschews crunchy, one-hex-on-the-battle-mat-equals-five-feet wargaming rules in favor of a quick, easy system which focuses on how the players\\' actions impact overall story and plot. It\\'s a radical departure from first- and second-generation roleplaying games, but it\\'s an approach which holds a lot of appeal for me personally-- even if it might not be for everyone.

       " \"The Fate Freeport Companion offers a great setting (who doesn't love a fantasy pirate theme?), however, the reworked skillset kind of limits the game somewhat. It seems like every other creature or NPC has a main stat that is great (+4 to rolls) or better for combat. This is countered by them not being able to take consequences like your character can, but it makes combat encounters pretty much a straight forward affair and the game is obviously based off a D20 type playstyle. D20 is great for what it is, a crunchy rule system for straight combat systems with little room for sway, however the Fate system is way more story focused and is about applying your characters strengths and weaknesses in unique ways. Combat and dice rolls are a very small part of the Fate Core experience and the Fate Freeport Companion seems to miss this concept. I still like the FFC because of the world, the characters, the ideas, and the overall concept and I can appreciate that Brian Engard and Clark Valentine were trying to combine these two systems in a way that made for a kind of 'common ground' feel, but it isn't freeform enough for one (Fate) and not rule specific enough for the other (D20).\\n\\nIf a retread were attempted to remove the more crunchy elements and the system were to focus on the pure Fate aspects of the city and gaming sessions, I could easily recommend this as must have for a resource book for people wanting a fleshed out fantasy setting for Fate sessions. As it is right now though, I wouldn't recommend this book for Fate fans or D20 fans on the whole. If you are looking for settings for a Fate game, the Fate Worlds books are a better value in that they give you a setting, a general concept of what is going on, examples of characters, main players, etc. while leaving enough open for you to customize your gaming sessions and I feel they are much better values for your money and time. That said, I really do hope this setting is revisited and more refined for the Fate system because it is a very, very nice setting and I will still be pulling stuff out of it for my gaming sessions, but I would recommend newer players avoid this book because the skill change and combat heavy elements might turn you away from what Fate is all about.\",\n",

It's new rule sets are a little vague on occasion, but that's fairly normal for such an abstract narrative focus game.\\n\\n2. Content\\nThis is a GREAT. Book for medium-heavy combat oriented groups. Even if a group isn't focused in such a way, the resources provided here are largely helpful to ideas on theme. It also helps detail mercenary groups who may be working against the PCs, so even if a GMs players aren't currently focusing on getting into big trouble, trouble may find them.

       " 'If you love playing chess and are interested in getting better, Fritz\\n\\n10 is definitely the one to get. There are a couple of stronger engines, like Rybka 2.1 and Hydra,\\n\\n but any engine strong enough to defeat the world champion is\\n\\nstrong enough for me. (Note: Kramnik recently lost to the Deep version\\n\\nof Fritz 10, but basically the difference between the two is less\\n\\nthan 30 elo points. And that\\'s on the slowest time control. (On any\\n\\ntime control of an hour or less per game, any of the top 5 chess programs\\n\\ndominates Kramnik and Topalov, the 2nd best human chess player.\\n\\n  Where the (world grandmaster strong engine) comes in handy is not in playing against it, (A most frustrating endeavor to be sure),\\n\\n but in helping a player \"see\" what the engine is thinking. No human or even chess program can play perfectly, but today\\'s top engines come\\n\\npretty darn close, as Kramnik can attest to.\\n\\n  You can of course tweak the engine to play weaker, but one\\n\\nbad point of Fritz is when it \"dumbs down\" it\\'s engine, it\\n\\ndoes so at the expense of realistic play. I.E. leaving a piece\\n\\nen prise, which doesn\\'t happen often even among \"mere\" experts.\\n\\nat slow time controls.\\n\\n  The user interface on Fritz 10 however is very user friendly. The browser like icons on top of the picture is one example.\\n\\nIf you\\'re not sure what an icon is for, just hover the mouse over\\n\\nthem and it will tell you. Everything is customizable from the\\n\\nlook and feel of the board to the sounds, even to such minute\\n\\ndetails like the look of the fonts on the notation.\\n\\nAll very intuitive.\\n\\n  There is an updated database (to 9/06) which includes the\\n\\ncontroversial Topalov-Kramnik match. You can search among\\n\\n1,100,000 games by name, opening, position, even endgame pieces.\\n\\n  You can play some historical games by such great players\\n\\nlike Fischer and Capablanca, and you can see how many \"inaccuracies\"\\n\\nthey made. And brilliant moves as well.\\n\\n  But for me, the best part of Fritz 10 or any chessbase compatible\\n\\nchess program, is the play server. That alone is worth the price\\n\\nof the program. It\\'s simply the best place to play. At this server,\\n\\nyou also get to watch grandmasters play blitz and whenever there is a\\n\\nbig tourney like Linares or a world championship match you can watch\\n\\nevery move LIVE. And unlike most chess servers, here all your games\\n\\nare kept on a separate database that you played online, and study\\n\\nthem with the help of your world class analysis partner, Fritz.\\n\\n  This is very long I realize but I haven\\'t come close to touching\\n\\non all the features like training modes, 3-D graphics, chess variants\\n\\nlike giveaway and chess 960, importing chess books etc.\\n\\n  If you have Fritz 9 and your one year subscription to it\\'s playchess\\n\\nserver has not yet expired, then perhaps you don\\'t need to get Fritz 10.\\n\\nBut if you\\'re anyone else who plays chess and loves following the\\n\\ngames of great players, then you won\\'t go wrong with Fritz 10.',\n",
       " \"If you're new to chessbase engines, Fritz is absolutely the one to get.  It has all the features you want: great database, an engine you can customize to your level, great analysis function, a computer that can beat the socks off you if you need it.  And of course, the program is designed ideally for Fritz.  If you go for one, only get Fritz.\\n\\nHere's what I thought about some of the new features: The 3d improvements are great for a few games.  Then you go back to 2D because it's still easier.  I've run this program against several others on my computers.  It matches well against Rybka and is superior to everything else.  If you already own another recent chessbase engine, though, you won't find anything really new here.\",\n",
       " 'Fritz 10 is the latest and greatest version of the German chess program put out by ChessBase, a specialist in chess database and playing software. It boasts a set of new features and improvements over its predecessor, and all indicators suggest that it delivers. That said, Fritz 10 may or may not be a wise purchase, depending on why you want it.\\n\\nI will start off by saying that if you are interested in this package as a playing partner and you already have a very strong chess engine to spar with, Fritz 10 is likely a waste of money for you. As another reviewer stated, the engine is so strong that it will crush all but the top grandmasters in the world, so casual play will be frustrating for hobbyists. However, if you want it because you plan to do some serious analysis work and you want the latest engine, it is worth more consideration, though there are stronger engines such as Shredder and Hiarcs. Fritz 10 does a nice job of automatically analyzing games, adding some natural language notations with the move notations, although it is debatable whether or not these notations are very useful.\\n\\nThe improvements over its predecessor are mainly in the GUI, not the engine (although the engine shows some promising improvements as well but does not drastically demonstrate strength over its predecessor, Fritz 9). There are some new training features such as showing the engine\\'s plans, which is a solid tool in the toolbox when trying to improve. The sparring and friend modes are also very helpful, though I must concur with the previous reviewer in that the engine makes some silly moves when you \"dumb it down\" to meet the player\\'s skill level.\\n\\nThe graphics ability of this package are much improved, offering better piece rendering and display. This is not necessarily a very important feature unless you like your eye candy.\\n\\nAs a UCI client, ChessBase seems to have ironed out the problems of the past. The GUI even seems to have a fairly good idea of how strong imported engines are, which is made clear when playing rated games. In testing a few imported engines, Fritz 10 did well in managing these engines and everything was stable.\\n\\nUpdates to the PlayChess interface include weather reporting. I have to ask: How useful is this in a chess program?\\n\\nOverall, Fritz 10 is a very nice package and is worth the money if you want a strong program that can analyze games and can connect you to other players on the net. There are stronger engines out there (and some of them are free downloads) so if you are looking for the very best engine on the market, this isn\\'t it. Also, if you have an earlier version and you want it because it\\'s \"the latest and greatest\" in the hopes of getting a hugely improved playing engine, you\\'ll probably be disappointed. However, if you want pretty graphics and an intuitive interface or if you are looking for a good training tool that can help you to understand your game a little better, Fritz 10 is a good choice.',\n",
       " \"I'd love to be here giving it a great review, seeing as I wanted a chess program that Fritz advertises itself as being, but Amazon is pretty much selling a worthless DVD.  I have to register everytime I use this DVD.  I have to remove the whole program and then re-register everytime I want to use it.  What's the freakin point of including a registration number that won't work?  Basically, I have a $20 cup coaster.\\n\\nYeah, this isn't exactly a review of the program, so take it for what it is, but beware of the trash you're likely to receive.\",\n",
       " 'Been trying to play this program for about two weeks.  Everything about it seems overly complicated yet poorly programmed.  Difficulty levels seem to vary wildly no matter what settings you choose and the tournament games keep freezing up.  Then I realized the game was not freezing up, but that I could move my opponents pieces but not my own.  Tried doing the online update to see if this would fix the problems and the update kept crashing whenever I tried to install it.  Very frustrating.',\n",
       " 'Plenty of features and I wouldn\\'t be without it. It was easy to install Rybka as my engine of choice. But ... I just wish Apple would buy the company and do its magic on the whole package. For example you just can\\'t double click on \"game.pgn\" on your desktop and expect it to open in Fritz. Instead you get the last game you looked at.',\n",
       " 'I am not going to write a book here because a lot of the others have done a good job in explaining the software. What i wanted to say is that this game teaches,is controlable, looks great, and is good for at anyones level. If you are going to buy a Chess Program this is the one to buy. You will learn alot for sure.',\n",
       " 'Fritz is arguably the most commercially-successful and popular chess package available. I started using Fritz at version 6 and have purchased most of the upgrades, up to version 10. With each successive version the whole package has gotten better and better though some of the upgrades were more worthwhile than others (one reason I never purchased version 11). Version 12 is a quantum leap forward, though it is still not perfect.\\n\\nInstallation from the DVD was painless and uneventful. However, there is one issue with the installation that bothered me - the installer never installed a desktop icon or a program group, so I needed to navigate to the installation directory, from which I made a shortcut to the application binary on the desktop. After this step, everything has worked smoothly and I can launch the application without issue.\\n\\nThe interface has gotten a huge facelift - this is not a color scheme change or rearrangement of the menus and toolbars, but rather it is a complete overhaul with Windows ribbon controls serving up the components. Normally, I would be wary of such a large change to the overall interface, but ChessBase has done an excellent job of designing the interface and it is very well-organized. There is a learning curve, though, for people who have grown very accustomed to the older ChessBase interface, as some things are a little difficult to find unless you have familiarity... Given a couple of hours of exploration, the interface becomes second nature and finding things becomes easy again.\\n\\nThe Fritz engine itself is a strong one, able to crush practically any human player (including seasoned grandmasters) with ease when used at full playing strength and it holds its own against other top-drawer engines. It is not the strongest engine available, but for the vast majority of players it doesn\\'t need to be the strongest. When using an engine this strong, playing against it is not the most useful activity; where engines of this strength are most useful is in the analysis of games.\\n\\nFritz includes several analysis modes, my favorite being full analysis for post-mortem scrutiny of games. The full analysis function works backward through a game and adds move suggestions as well as canned commentary as the selected chess engine evaluates each position. Though the English commentary is not always especially informative (for example, comments like \"This is a futile try to save the game\" are common), the comments do add a more \"personal\" touch to the analysis which would otherwise be simply a dump of suggested moves. When the engine finds an especially good move, the commentary is usually a little more helpful.\\n\\nI found an annoying glitch with the Full Analysis mode. After fully analyzing a game, the interface simply chopped the last quarter of the game from the report, even though I could still iterate through all of the moves. I never could get the rest of the analysis on the screen.\\n\\nAnother very helpful analysis mode is \"Infinite Analysis\" which takes a single position and continuously analyzes it until the engine is interrupted or the position is changed. This is especially helpful for taking a deep look at a position and trying several what-if scenarios.\\n\\nDeep position analysis is another mode, as is Monte Carlo, though I have used these so little that I cannot really comment on them.\\n\\nThe last analysis mode I will talk about is \"Engine Shootout\" which takes a position and feeds it to two or more engines for analysis. These engines evaluate the position and play through, with the intent of determining how the game would proceed and the outcome as a result. Though it\\'s a feature I really don\\'t need, it is something I use occasionally to look at games I have played when the game was unfinished but the outcome wasn\\'t clear. Different engines arrive at different conclusions which makes this even more intriguing.\\n\\nThe Fritz package includes a large database of games, which can be used to explore and analyze. Where I find this database to be most useful is in researching specific styles of play. For example, it is easy to track down all of Tal\\'s games and follow his playing style with the database search functions.\\n\\nAlso included on the DVD is a set of training videos. To be honest I have never found these to be especially helpful but others may very well benefit from them.\\n\\nThe UCI interface continues to improve, so adding in UCI engines is easy and reliable. I have found several weaker engines against which I can play so I have them bound into the interface for playing. I use the Fritz 12 engine for analysis after the fact.\\n\\nCentral to the Fritz interface is access to the ChessBase chess server. Through the interface, players can log into the server, play games, read chess-related news, watch seminars, and observe important matches with live coverage.\\n\\nThere are a couple of different versions to this package. The version sold by ChessBase and its resellers sports a green box whereas the version sold through Viva Media comes in a black box. I noticed an appreciable price difference and I investigated that difference. The software appears to be the same; the real difference is in the access given to the chess server. The more expensive package offers a 1-year premium membership which gives access to all content on the server such as seminars, elite tournament coverage and other content. The less expensive package also offers a 1-year membership but the access is more limited and excludes much of the premium content. Both offer guest access which allows anyone to log in and play games without hindrance, but as a guest so there is no tracking of progress. Which kind of access you desire should be considered when choosing which package you need.\\n\\nFritz 12 is a big step forward and is a worthwhile upgrade from previous versions. The engine is stronger and the interface is vastly superior. It is not without its glitches but the problems seem to be few in number.',\n",
       " 'After I installed the program and played a game and closed the game window there was no way to play again. No icon on the desktop or any play function in the installed game in the computer. Re-installing did not work. Contacted the manufacturer and heard nothing back.',\n",
       " 'This game is the best chess program out there that I know of. It plays excellent chess and the pieces look nice. However, when you move the ELO slide to the minimum, it plays really hard, about 1100 ELO rating. I played it at this level using Online Chess Kingdom and Chess master (PSP games) at the highest level vs. fritz set to the min level, and so they lost to fritz. It was easy to tell Fritz wasn\\'t playing at 1100 ELO, but closer to 2000. The PS3 version of Fritz doesn\\'t have this shortcoming, you feel drastic changes at different ELO ratings, but this computer version you don\\'t feel much ELO change. Another shortcoming is that the game freezes if you choose the \"render light\" option, it slows down significantly if you improve all the graphics in the option menu, and the game flashes once in a while. Some windows don\\'t close despite they have the \"x\". The clicking sound can be deactivated, but it takes some googling time to find out how. On the positive site, the sense of humor is a unique touch, since playing chess can get really quiet. This game could use more chess sets and picture wall papers like in Chess Master. Everything else, I wouldn\\'t change.',\n",

The program is smart enough to obliterate just about anyone, but you can play the game at several different difficulty levels. It even has a friend mode where the computer determines how strong a chess player you are and plays at close to your level. This is one tough opponent - even in the friend mode. There are also several \"personalities\" you can play against. Each personality has preprogrammed strengths and weaknesses (including how badly it blunders). You can also change several of their attributes to make them a stronger or weaker player.\\n\\nFritz 12 is packed with training tools. You can set the game up so it suggests opening moves; warns you if a square you are about to move to is under attack; give you hints or suggested moves; tell you what your opponent is planning to do; and much more.\\n\\nThe free beginner training videos are good. There are also several sample videos for other topics included, in hopes you decide to purchase additional training videos.\\n\\nEven at full price this is a terrific training tool and should certainly help you improve your game, even though you may get a bit frustrated if you like to win.',\n",

I totally agree with all the excellent things other reviewers have said, but do consider this: On June 10, 2011, World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand told Chessvibes.com his preferred engine was Houdini over both Rybka and Fritz. Deep Fritz 13 (not 12) now has Houdini 3 installed into it and is the ultimate way to prepare for an OTB tournamemnt by weeding out any inconsistencies in your favorite openings. Deep Fritz 12 is still important however since you can install the free Houdini 1.5 download (ELO 3250) or the Houdini 3 Pro version (current CCRL rating 3347) in the Fritz engine management tab under the:\"create a UCI engine\" option. Why is a high ELO rating so important?Because when you go to your next OTB tournament, rest assured at least one of your opponents will have his openings down pat with many new ideas and  all inconsistancies worked out well in advance and approved by the worlds strongest engine which is Houdini. If you prefer to rely on the weak main lines and sloppy analysis found in both the \"Secrets of Opening Surprises\" or \"Dangerous Weapons\" books then you may learn the hard way (as I did)by losing many games after reaching terrible positions during the critical opening stages of the game. So I agree with all the good things said about Deep Fritz 12, but its really the excellent GUI(Graphic User Interface) provided that makes Fritz invaluable in creating a truly powerful opening arsenal that will give your opponents something to think about.',\n",

Also I used the free SCIDvsPC.  I have started taking chess lessons over the phone using a screen sharing program and my instructor uses Chessbase for his lesssons and homework assignments. After my introductory lessons it was clear that I needed a full version of Chessbase.\\n\\nIt is the most expensive of the commerical database programs but it is probably the most widely used by top-level players and chess journalists.  This large installed base of customers is a definite plus.\\n\\nSpecific complaints about Chessbase 12\\n  - Documentation errors.  The Help files (and downloadable manual) often refer to features from older verions of Chessbase which have since been updated.  Worse I think some of the help is for another product (like Fritz--also made by Chessbase).\\n  - Notation Pane often goes blank.  You have to click on the Notation Pane scroll-bar to restore the notation.\\n  - More board customization. I prefer lower-case board coordinates.  Chessbase only has upper-case and it makes the coordinates too distracting.  Also there is no option to place coordinates on all 4 sides of the board (The print option allows this).\\n  - No explanation of certain features.  The engine pane is the worst example. There is an indicatior light that usually is grey but sometimes goes red, green or yellow. The help says this is  \"Fail High/Low\".  That\\'s it.  I finally found what it means by searching the internet and finding an article on the engine.\\n\\nIn summary I really like Chessbase 12 but I think it would nice if the developers would improve some existing functions rather than add features that are nice but have limited value for most players like Cloud Analysis and Let\\'s Check.  Of course many people want these leading edge features and will pay to upgrade.',\n",

       " \"I've owned all versions of chessbase starting from cb7. There were a lot of little bugs in CB11, and this version (CB12) fixes most of those. A few that are fixed now:\\n\\n- When Chessbase is restarted and a function to display a window is taken, the window will be the same size and in the same location it was last opened at. Before (CB11), multiple monitor systems with different resolution monitors would always put the windows partly off the top of the screen with an extra long vertical dimension, and they always required adjustment in order to be useful.\\n\\n- The x for canceling cb windows no longer disappears when the computer goes to sleep and is reawakened. Before, the x would no longer show after the computer was restarted from sleep mode. To cancel required right clicking on the icon in the task bar and then selecting close window. Edit: 1/22/13 this bug still exists on cb12.\\n\\n- The ribbon menus are more consistent when the option to default to a minimize ribbon is used. Right click on a blank area of a ribbon menu, and select `minimize ribbon' to use that feature. When you want access to a menu, click on the section you want (e.g. Home) and the ribbon menu is displayed as a drop down.\\n\\nToo me, the most noticeable feature added is the 'Let's check' database when running computer analysis. While running analysis, the top moves selected by various commercial chess engines are also displayed with the number of plies searched by each engine and the position evaluation. This database is updated primarily by Chessbase and Fritz user's own computers. When a user's engine calculates deeper into the position (more plies), it's evaluation updates CB's let's check database. Subsequent users (from anywhere in the world!) will see that evaluation next time they arrive at the same position. Updating of Let's Check database can be turned off, but is on by default.\\n\\nOne of the nicest features of Chessbase, that competing products seem to lack, is the ability to open chess boards, databases, opening books, etc. outside of the main environment window. This feature has been available since CB8. The reason this is so useful, is because it's very common to have many chessboards and databases open at the same time. Trying to fit them in a single environment window is often problematic. With Chessbase, they can be placed and sized anywhere on the desktop. Even within a chessboard window, the engine evaluations, opening book, and move list can be moved outside of the chessboard, or automatically made to fit in the window that's dedicated to that chessboard.\\n\\nFor someone that researches openings, tournaments, players, and/or historical games, I don't think there is a better product.  Alternatives I'm aware of are Convetka's Chess Assistant, and several freeware products (SCID and Chessdb are ones I've looked at before).\",\n",
       " \"This was exactly what my daughter needed.  Her Chessbase 9 program was no longer quite meeting her needs so she was thrilled to get this updated version.  She tells me it is so cool and has lots of additional features.  She couldn't be happier, and the seller threw in a helpful DVD on installation and usage.\",\n",
       " \"If you like the fritz family of chessbase software this will be the same old same old with some new features. The feature that tells you the level of play that is ongoing in a game is a fun feature. For example when I'm making solid moves my elo will be in the 1800s or 1900s and when I play a crummy move or series of moves it can go down to 1500 elo. Kind of interesting to look at as you play the fritz engine. Kind of buggy in places but chessbase always updates and corrects any errors. Good on three machines which is vastly improved. Fritz engine seems like the same as always but I usually will download the latest stockfish engine for free and use that anyway. Overall very similar to previous versions but an excellent program in and of itself. Would recommend unless you have 15 or so.\",\n",
       " \"I was skeptical about the new GUI. The old interface is still there nonetheless. I really enjoyed the easy mode. Clicking on the pieces gives you a quick assessment visually on the board. It is great to see potential combinations and focus though on the intended plan.  There are other new features too, just look up Chessbase's YouTube videos about the new Fritz 16 interface.  I am pleasantly surprised and this replaces Fritz 15 GUI for me.  Yes, other engines are stronger and you can get Stockfish 8 and use it under Fritz as a UCI engine.  I find this to be Chessbase's best GUI overhaul I can think of (going back to Fritz 7).  I am also using this on an iMac running WIndows 10 with VMWare Fusion and there are no issues.\",\n",

The easy mode doesn\\'t allow time controls (if they do, I couldn\\'t figure out how to do it).  The \"classic\" interface gives hints when you pick up the piece (I searched the manual and all the settings to turn this off, to no avail - I also sent an email and no answer).  After 2 weeks, I am giving up on it and going back to the Fritz 14 interface.  To add insult to injury, Houdini 4 beat Fritz 16 in a engine match 6 to 1. This was on 5 min games using 2 CPUs.  However, I was pleased to see that when I increased the time to 15 minutes and processing to 4 CPUs, Fritz 16 was undefeated (5 and 0) - Houdini 4 only allowed 3 CPUs)',\n",
       " 'As a Chess playing program it is too strong for most humans so any improvements are almost irrelevant.\\n\\nThe user interface is more important in distinguishing between such programs and unfortunately the same basic problems from previous versions still exist.\\n- some databases are buried in system files on the C drive, with no option to set where they are saved. Separate software is required to manage them\\n- No help file, it just wanders off into a redundant web-browser with a pathetic Google-like translation of German into some sort of pidgin English\\n- Confusing implementation of the Ribbon with a mix of styles and formats; regularly have to hunt the right option\\n- Opens irrelevant games when launching program\\n\\nThe new bright yellow initial screen is a mostly useless gimmick, and not helped by the buttons to close the program being hidden off screen.',\n",

Kasparov's take on chess history is fascinating, but his method of presentation is better for strong players than weaker players.  This is definitely NOT the DVD to buy a child who is just learning the game.  To pull a number out of my head, I'd say you should only buy this if you're rated 1800 USCF or higher, and here's why.\\n\\nI learn the most, and I think most people learn the most, from methodical discussion of important games, then trying to apply that into my own games, then trying to figure out where I went wrong.  Kasparov only spends about 4 minutes per game (!!??!!).  He's assuming the viewer already knows how to execute plans in the middle game that arise from the opening.\\n\\nI got this DVD on sale, so it was definitely worth the money, and it includes an annotated game collection, so I'm sure I'll be referring back to it for years.  But I had to purchase a different Queen's Gambit DVD, just so I would have the background necessary to understand this one.\",\n",
       " \"This is truly a rare treat.  Garry Kasparov, quite likely the best openings expert in the history of chess, and World Champion for about 15 years, has here given a very valuable overview of one of the most fundamentally important openings in chess, the Queens' Gambit Declined.  The DVD is in the form of a games collection, with all of the major variations covered.  Kasparov's presentation is fascinating.  He gives a blend of historical background and fundamental instruction.  His accent is rather strong, but he is quite eloquent, charismatic and in general easy to understand.  You will not get every theoretical variation that you would need to play the Queen's Gambit at a high level with such a general overview, of course, but this DVD is so compelling and well done that any chess player from casual club player up to master (and probably beyond) will benefit from the presentation.  Don't miss the chance to get instruction from the player that many consider the strongest player of all time.  Even if you don't play the Queen's Gambit you will profit from Kasparov's explanations, and you will enjoy yourself as you learn!  Very highly recommended.\",\n",

It's a strategic rather than tactical simulation: you administer your space program and watch your missions run, but you don't fly them yourself.  If you want to fly spacecraft, a better choice would be Orbiter or Microsoft Space Simulator.  But if you're interested in running a space program and watching your ships go to the Moon, this game is fantastic.

After getting fed up with attempting to calibrate the system correctly, I now move back and forth between the two televisions whenever I wish to play a musical rhythm game.  Obviously, for vocals, an HDTV can be used uncalibrated, as, if you know the song, you do not need to watch the notes go by, so I had had the Xbox plugged into this.  Later, when I decided to switch TVs to play my guitar, I eventually replugged in the microphone in the same USB port that I had plugged it in previously.  It didn\\'t work.  Now frustrated, I retried every port, only to finally find one that worked, which happened to be the very first port I\\'d tried previously.  I later came to find that the microphone I received had a short in the wire, almost as if it were used (which is entirely possible, as I got no packaging, only a plastic wrapper around the microphone).  As for the performance itself when I actually get the thing to work, it works nicely.  It picks up on my voice fairly well, although you have to keep it at a very precise angle, or it may lose lower volumes.  There is enough cord length that I can sing at my preferred distance (although I sit very close to my televisions, so take this statement with a grain of salt).

       " 'The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural is written \"in-character\" and presented as a faux artifact from the era of the Old Republic.  It contains detachable items, intended to enhance the feeling that you have something really of the Star Wars universe.  This adds much to the enjoyment and presentation of the book.\\n\\nThe journal was written both as a stand-alone book, and to be part of the Collectors Edition of Star Wars: The Old Republic.  I bought the Collectors Edition before the game launched, in preparing my gaming guild (Sons of Numenor/Scions of Korriban) to play it.  Of all the real and in-game items included as part of the Collectors Edition, this was the most rewarding.  It complements the content presented online at the games website, and fits well among other books related to Star Wars lore.  If there is anything disappointing, it is that the book is not longer.  As the stories and narratives are fascinating, and do much to add depth and flavor to characters and story beyond it.\\n\\nThis book is worth having as a Star Wars collector, on just one seeking to add a bit more depth to their knowledge of its lore.  If ones plays Star Wars: The Old Republic, it is very much worth having.  These will become more rare by the month.  Complete copies, with all of the included detached items, will become even more rare.\\n\\nI would also strongly recommend two specific books in addition to this.  They are \"The Jedi Path,\" and \"The Book of Sith.\"  (either the stand-alone edition, or the excellent \"Vault\" editions.)  Each of those two books, are written and presented in the same artifact style as this journal.  They are among the most collectable Star Wars books, and fit perfectly alongside The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural.  Do look them up and be aware of them, if you find this book interesting.\\n\\nAt the timing of writing this, you can buy this book alone, for prices ranging about $17.  The full Collectors Edition of Star Wars: The Old Republic has dipped as low as $29 at in-store locations, and averages in the $80 range on Amazon.  The full Collectors Edition does come with other items of worth to collectors, but having this book is worth buying it alone if need-be.',\n",

I did check and have the problem across more than one tv, so it's not the tv's fault. I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii, but I doubt so, as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with (why, Wii, did you not include component/hdmi cabling by default?

Overall in a simple connection it should work fine, but in a entertainment system where are some other devices, as home theater, networking equipment, etc, the cable will pick a LOT of Noise.  Also it should be a permanent installation, since it is not sturdy enough to resist multiple pulling in / out of the connectors.  Otherwise it will do the trick, and having your WII in 480P will not make it a HD console, that the wii is not capable of, but picture will be clearer, sharper (I don\\'t know, but in my 40\" LCD image out of the standard cable seems a bit blurry)and with more defined colors',\n",

Then I realized that I have to go to the Wii set up menu to change from 480i to 480p.  After that the picture was much better.  Netflix \"Instant\" streaming movies now look as good as playing the DVD.  The image is sized to fill my wide screen HD TV.\\n\\nThe cable itself has full sized plugs for video and audio.

The picture looked great because of the aspect ratio; video game systems were built around televisions like this.  We soon decided we wanted a bigger and better image and upgraded to a 37' Vizio LCD.  We were saddened to see picture quality decrease exponentially and quickly became confused as to why our Wii didn't look great on what we knew to be a much better television.  We found these cables online and after applying them noticed the picture was 100% better in quality.\\n\\nLong story short:  Researched component cables, found them on Amazon for a great price.

Porsche wasn't a sim, but it struck a perfect balance between a sim and arcade. Motor City Online was also an excellent game that was slightly ahead of it's time. Everyone didn't have access to high speed internet yet so they allowed dial-up user to play which caused allot of lag and probably was the main reason the game didn't take off like it should have. I'm not the best driver but MCO offer several other avenues of game play. I'm an old school mechanic so I love building and modify cars, even setup up a dedicated website where I built and sold custom virtual engines. Even had numerous offers from people wanting to buy my custom engines thinking they were real. The auction was also a great feature, I'd get up at3 amjust to get a better deal on a part or car.

       " 'These are the second and third installments in the Nancy Drew PC line and while they might not be as graphically stimulating as the newer games and little bit on the short (not too short) side, the originals have something the newer games sometimes lack; an in-depth intriguing mystery that actually takes place like an actual crime/mystery that you would need to put a lot of thought and logic into to actually solve; just like on CSI. The second and third installments: Stay Tuned for Danger and Message in a Haunted Mansion are a step up-- graphics-wise -- from the original Secrets Can Kill PC game, but pale in comparison to the newer games. However that\\'s to be expected the late 90\\'s versus the beginning of the second decade of the twenty first century. There have been some complaints as to the older version games not being able to play on newer OS, that would be incorrect. We have OS\\'s Windows: XP, Vista and 7; we have Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill (original), Stay Tuned for Danger, Message in a Haunted Mansion plus almost the rest of the Nancy Drew PC line running on these OS\\'s. If you computer\\'s OS isn\\'t smart enough to switch over to the formats for you you can try the following instructions below; otherwise the game will install, but will not play because it was intended to run a much larger file in a much smaller window (I know that doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense, but it is correct in the way I explained it). This is what you need to do if you have a newer computer/OS (Windows: XP, Vista, 7, 8) and you are trying to play this older model game: You need to first install the game. It will do a computer anaylisis and will tell you that your computer \"Fails\" under two categories 1.) Color Resolution and 2.) OS (Operating System), ignore and install the game anyway. If you click to play the game after the install and an \"Error\" message appears close it and manually change your computer\\'s compatibility mode. To set your computer to run in Compatibility Mode: This can be accessed from the Control Panel; just type in \"Older Version\" in the Control Panel Search Bar and the link will show up. Click it. A Dialog box will pop up and ask which version of Windows you would like to run this program in, choose either Windows: 95, 98 or ME. The computer should ask you if you wish to save this profile for every time you use this particular program click \"Yes\" or \"Apply\". Also from the Control Panel or by Right Clicking on your Desktop under \"Screen Resolution\" switch your pixel resolution all the way down to 800x600. If for some reason you computer does not switch back to normal once you\\'ve ejected the game, then once again, just reset the changes manually. The same goes for the fact, if your computer does not automatically set itself back to an older version of windows and a smaller screen resolution when you play the game again; just do it manually, it literally takes two minutes, both ways. Regardless of how much the graphics may suck, any older model game can play on a newer computer/OS whether it\\'s on a CD-ROM or a Floppy Diskette (as long as you have a USB enabled External Floppy Diskette Drive or you hard wire one into your Desktop).',\n",

You can also burn them to a CD and show them to your friends. While this does sound awesome, the execution is not done all that well. The first thing you will notice is how dated the graphics are, even for 2006. Deus Ex (released in 2000) looks much better than this does. The animations are sloppy and the environments look bland. For the audio, the sounds effects are very stock and unimpressive. The music for the game is also pretty generic. However, you can put your own music into the game that you create if you change the format of the audio file. The game-play is decent enough. Being able to create your games from scratch is enjoyable. There is a good amount of customization you have when creating your games from the objectives of the level to the rewards for beating it. As you complete certain tasks, you unlock new features which give you much more customization to the various features of the levels. However, the mechanics are very limited. After testing out your games, you realize that the games feel very clunky. The controls are some of the worst in video games and there is absolutely no way to change the key bindings. Also, there is nothing really \"tycoon\" about it. You\\'re not making games to sell them and there isn\\'t any business aspect to it. It\\'s very strange considering the word \"tycoon\" is in the title. Overall, I feel disappointed with this game. The concept is cool enough, but the execution was not up to par.

But, if you\\'ve dabbled in Empire Earth, AOE, Age of Mythology, and enjoy these economy based warfare games, definitely give ANNO 2070 a shot. There is a learning curve, particularly if you are a newcomer to the series. Essentially, this game is about meeting the needs (food, drink, belongings, entertainment, community, etc.) of your citizens, which become increasingly demanding as they rise from the ranks of common workman to something equivalent of CEO. With their progression brings higher taxes income, yielding a stronger economy capable of building and supporting an impressive military. Warfare is not necessarily the focus, or even the majority of the fun, in this game, but it still gives the option for ship, submarine, and aerial combat, with several units of each type available. You can even go nuclear. It\\'s pretty sweet. There are three \"races\" of people. It\\'s a bit like Starcraft in that they can each build their own units, and have their own specific needs. The first group is the ECOS - they are the liberal hippy tree huggers who care only about thee environment, and turn unhappy if the ecobalance becomes too polluted. The 2nd group, the TYCOONS, are the seal clubbin\\' oil drillin\\' conservatives who care only about making money no matter the cost. Finally, you have the TECHS, a faction only concerned with technological research. The TECHS are featured moreso in the expansion (ANNO 2070: Deep Ocean), but are still important for development of ECO and TYCOON needs as they advance. I highly recommend the expansion if you play this and find you like it - it adds so many new ways to develop your cities. I love this game. I\\'ve always been a fan of city builders, but this one (like ANNO 1404) has really drawn me in. I\\'ve put in weeks worth of hours on it and am still playing. The campaign missions are fun, but the real joy lies in a continuous game. Once you are comfortable playing, you can spend literally hours on a hard continuous game with 3 AI players, a pirate base, and a warship hellbent on your destruction. It is still a challenge even after playing for over a year. I think a lot of what makes it fun is that no two games are ever played the same way. There are different ways to power your city, different upgrades to utilize, different ways to destroy your opponents. A quick note about DRM: It sucks that this game must be played with a constant internet connection. There is a multi-player faction, but honestly I\\'ve never even tried it. Single player is what I enjoy, and there\\'s no reason to be online for that. Still, I give it five stars, because the game itself warrants it IMO.',\n",

This entailed screen caps of receipts, manual covers and proof of a real CD (they were very helpful). Ok, Now I can play... NOT! Every time it loaded, it Crashed To Desktop (CTD). Ok, so now I have spent another day looking up info on the web about that. I had to lower my computer resolution to 800x600 AND change some of the graphics settings to low AND had to turn off stuff in the uPlay settings. Ok, finally got a profile setup (and you only get 1). Now, I get to play... NOT! Every time I accept a side mission it CTD's and I have to kill the proses just to exit the game. I can put up with a lot of stuff if the game runs, but I cannot deal with having to save before every quest, mouse over on the info tabs, etc just in case my game crashes. Hell, I cannot even play single missions without it crashing. I was hoping the expansion would help stabilize it, but I have decided to send them both back. I was willing to put up with uPlay, even if the DRM sucks. What do you mean I can't change my hardware? Ok, I have a laptop and thought that would be ok. Till I found out that 3 is the limit.

You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don\\'t confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn\\'t seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There\\'s no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn\\'t hard to do hand to hand. It wasn\\'t 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn\\'t bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don\\'t read if you can\\'t take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn\\'t believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals. Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can\\'t even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it\\'s a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower. Don\\'t waste your $ on the Pro Edition.',\n",

Codemasters also got hacked so I can't register to ask questions on their forum. At least the game was free when I bought a particular video card. Edit: I finally got the game to run after I deleted some sound driver called Rapture 3d that the game automatically installs. I ran a race and the game worked well with my Fanatec wheel. I left the game and came back later and none of my controller settings were saved so as I started a race I suddenly had to use the keyboard. I fixed the controller settings again and then I had no force feedback in the wheel. When the game works it's great. I've got the graphics completely maxed out and they look nice.

       " \"I'm not quite finished with the game's DiRT Tour mode, but I believe I've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer. And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome. Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics. The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen. There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series. At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium. Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options. Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you. Love this feature! Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity. I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal. Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty. But that's speeding on loose ground for you. Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2. Still no cigar, but it's a step forward. The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed. No issues whatsoever. If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore. It's the best DiRT so far.\",\n",

That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security. CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play. Annoying interface. Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do. Most settings don\\'t keep between sessions. Setting up a race takes way too long. Irritating \"music\" you can\\'t turn off (it keeps coming back). Takes too long to unlock things. Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.

This game was not worth the time, and I\\'ve yet to be able to actually play a full race. It took two evenings from when I got home from work until after midnight just to get this game installed. I wanted to try playing video games, so I bought a computer and some games. The installation takes hours, crashed my computer multiple times, required many dependencies (like \"MS games for windows live\") that must be installed separately. The only way to find out you need this other software is to search the forums... If you don\\'t have some dependency, after an hour of waiting the install finishes but the game doesn\\'t start. I even had to edit XML configuration files to get the program to start at all. The game can\\'t be played unless I am *both* logged into xbox live *and* have the DVD in the drive. I find that DVD\\'s scratch easily, I consider them transfer media not a reliable way to store data. Since they already have the DRM of a mandatory windows-live service, I don\\'t see why they would cripple the game even further with the disk requirement. For this reason, if you ignore my advice, at least get the downloadable version. I\\'ll probably copy the dvd image to disk as an iso with CloneDrive, but it\\'s an extra 7gb of data that has already been installed on my hard disk for a game that... can\\'t be played anyway. Once I finally ironed out the installation issues, and was actually able to get the game started, 2 minutes into each attempt at a car race the entire computer would crash. Black screen, unresponsive, numlock doesn\\'t even change the lights on my keyboard, needing a hard-reboot. I know some will assume I just don\\'t know how to install software, or that I have an old computer, or that I have viruses. I\\'m a software engineer with over a decade of software development experience. All of the other games I bought on Amazon or Steam worked fine (including one other that also required the windows live service). My computer is two weeks old and fast, i5, 8gb of ram, a discrete graphics card, nearly brand new. Even if this was a resource issue, the game shouldn\\'t consistently crash my entire computer to the point of needing a hard reboot. The price for the game isn\\'t high, but don\\'t waste your *time* on the PC version of this game.

       " \"I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games. I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt. Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak. You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1. The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it. Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude. The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time. Once you get past this, it does get better. At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down. I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting. I use a gamepad to play on the PC. I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA). The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow. The cars are not quite as varied as I would like. I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live. Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live. Many of the cars are available to purchase too. That is cheesy and not appreciated. You don't need to purchase these to advance though. The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3. I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2. Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

Especially as the computer controlled cars don't always seem to realize that you're right beside them, and will hit you, causing you to spin out, wreck, or generally have problems. One of the more annoying things about this game is that you have to sign up for Microsoft Live, or something like that. You get a predetermined name, which is generally nonsense.

       " 'As an avid SCCA rallyx driver, I was hoping to get something that was even a little bit like actually rally driving, but was severely disappointed. There is absolutely no relationship to driving this \"car\" to anything in real life, other than when you step on the gas it goes forward. In actual rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the car; its the defining quality of racing on dirt. To do that you need to be able to keep the steering wheel straight, and use the brake to shift weight forward and back to control car rotation. But in the game the car is impossible to steer straight going 5mpg on a straight road, let alone hit racing speeds. I tried every single possible controller setting, and even bought a brand-new wheel. Both had the same problem: turning the wheel 5 degrees results in the steering inputs reacting as if I turned the wheel 10, or 15, or 20, or 30 degrees depending on the speed. The only workaround I could find was the \"dead zone\", making the wheel inoperable while centered, and then it violently overracts when turned outside of the dead zone. Using that I could steer straight and then sharply turn, then go straight, then sharply turn. Ridiculous, yes, but if you watch videos of people driving on youtube.com that\\'s how the game was apparently designed. You\\'d think that a driver-oriented game would have a multitude of options for the most important aspect of driving: controlling the car. Instead, the game is horribly slowed down by useless eye-candy graphics and a ridiculously obtuse interface. Just starting the game and getting to the point of driving a car takes 10 minutes while you frantically hit the enter key trying to tell it to skip the fancy graphics and storyline and get on with the darn game. If its racing you want then iracing.com is still the only realistic option. This is worse than even Mario Kart!',\n",

       " 'Pros: The game is about driving all sorts of vehicles on all different terrain, and at that the game does very well. There are a number of different vehicles to unlock in each vehicle category and the tracks range from asphalt to dirt to snow, some mixing the various terrains in a single course. If anybody has played any of the Colin McRae Rally games, or naturally any of the previous Dirt games, they should feel right at home* (see Cons for *). The game basically has the player build up his fame to gain more sponsorships and be invited to tournaments and open new seasons. In the first season you are shown all terrains types and give the opportunity to learn gymkhana (~stunt driving~). The graphics are polished and high quality, especially on the vehicles, and engine audio is up to par. Gameplay is fairly straightforward, yet quite entertaining. Smashing your and opponent\\'s vehicles is a ton of fun and damage modeling is well done. Its just fun to drive and crash in the game. The game is very \"modular\" and can be picked up to play for just a short while or you can go all out and spend hours and hours. Cons: Gameplay can get repetitive, and even if the type of event is switched nearly every other race, you get to replay the same tracks, a number of times in different events (which are \"different\" really only by name). Car feel is somewhat bland, most cars in the same group feel very similar or nearly identical, the biggest difference you will feel is the stopping distance increase with more horsepower of the car. By contrast, this also makes it weird when a car actually behaves quite differently than the others, such as Ken Block\\'s car or the Original Mini Cooper. In conjunction to the above, car handling is a bit weird at times, might be me, using a keyboard, but, during a normal dirt rally stage, you pretty much cannot recover from a real handbrake turn. Not sure if it is because of car tuning or abs still on (abs should not matter, but it\\'s the only thing I have on) but once the car\\'s back-end has slid around past say 20 degrees off center, the slide is irrecoverable. Does not matter if you apply full opposite lock, does not matter if you break, accelerate, or just let go of the gas pedal, does not matter what type of turn it is (shy of a hairpin), your call will keep sliding in the same direction, potentially getting more sideways, until you crash or slow down to 10 km/h (6mp/h). Games for Windows Live - whenever you see this logo, be afraid, very afraid! In Dirt 3, you will HAVE TO have or create a Windows Live account, or you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE THE GAME. Or play online for that matter. This is just some crappy DRM scheme and I was quite sad to find out about it, as this, plus having to always have the dvd in your drive, makes just booting the game an annoyance. Once all is set up, its not that bad of a hassle, but still, why punish players that buy the game? The menus and animations, and introductions will drive you up a wall. The are cool the first 100 times, -_- , not allowing me a way to skip them is just cruel. You will notice this the most when you enter a race: unskippable animation to show you your car, 1 second pause, menu pops up with \"Race\" and \"Mod car stuff\", etc, and then another 5 second animation to show you your car again, but on the starting grid, 1 second pause, and then its time to race, 3 second countdown till you can actually drive. Also every time you select an item from the race menu (those triangle things) again, animation, 1 second halt, here is what you ordered, oh new selection, sorry that need another animation. * People that were used to the Colin McRae games might be wondering where real rally went in the game. The one with the stages, and having to spend time in between races to repair damage, having to complete a few stages of a race with a half broken car. The special feeling of being part of the WRC is mostly gone. Now most races are on the short side (they do get longer as you progress), can be restarted at any point and no previous-race progress is lost, and even more there is the rewind feature. Naturally you do not need to use these mechanics, but just being there spoils the mood. Other Thoughts: It may seem like I slammed the game pretty hard, but then gave it a strangely high mark. The point is that the game is good, quite good, despite all the above issues, which all in all are actually fairly small things. Plus the cheap price bumps it up a notch. You will want to immediately turn off all assists (keep the driving line and abs at first, then decide for yourself) else the car basically drives itself. The loss of a true rally mode may be a make it or break it deal for somebody. The game is really fun, the driving is very fun regardless of the issues stated above, yet you will miss good ol\\' Colin. I would have given the game 3.5 out of 5, just because of the great stuff lost over the years, but I realized that it was not fair to compare it with something that (unfortunately) it is not anymore. For $12 it\\'s a great deal.',\n",
       " 'I greatly enjoyed Dirt 2 and picked up Dirt 3 for more dirt racing action (truck racing is my favorite). I actually found this rather duller than Dirt 2, less \"game-like,\" the locations a bit monotonous, and way too much emphasis on gymkhana, when what I really want is land rush, rally, rally cross. Requiring gymkhana to advance past the first level is annoying, to say the least, and may be a deal breaker for some people. However, it is possible to modify the database file to completely unlock the game. In fact, you can modify the database to unlock all the cars, all the races. Just google \"dirt 3 unlock mod.\" The file is a replacement for \"database.bin\" - so all you have to do is search for that file, save the original file as backup and replace it with the unlocked database. (And, after you play through to the next level, you can put the original file back.) It\\'s a fairly easy fix even for the so-so computer literate. The upshot though is, Codemasters could have included an option to bypass gymkhana for those just wanting rally and not screech-braking in a parking lot.

I had to eliminate the force feedback and tweak it quite a bit to have it to a point where the delay would have a minimal interference with gameplay. The competitions in the game are lame and it is not a game that invites you to play. The career mode is lame in that they make you do all sorts of challenges like spinning your car and making it skid, and then different styles of racing (rally, tarmak, race with others on dirt) with lame cars. If you like one particular style of racing, you are really forced to do all styles so it gets old.

       " \"In today's game market it's easy to miss racing games that aren't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises. Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks. -If you want to win, employ a Fin!\",\n",

Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off. As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating. Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss. Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it. I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.

I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it.

Next, put your YDKJ CD or ISO image in, capture the drive, (this trick works with any Jack game save for 5th Dementia...you\\'ll just have to install and play that one on the virtual machine), install the game, then copy the entire contents of the Jack CD (save for the setup files), overwrite anything and everything, then try running the game without the CD.

Most of the questions are in multiple choice, but there are different types: picture questions, fill in the blanks, whatshisname questions, gibberish questions, dis or dat choices, and the final round of the game is called Jack Attack (an association question). I\\'ve found the gibberish questions the most difficult because it takes me a little longer to remember movies that sound like what appears on the screen. Also, if you play the game with more than one person there is a \"screw your neighbor round\" where you can force someone else to answer a question instead of yourself. This is a wonderful game that I thoroughly enjoy playing. Highly recommended for trivia and movie buffs that own a computer.',\n",
       " \"I bought this for my sister to settle a score from our childhood. I remember owning it as a kid, and it was amusing, but pales in comparison to today's home animation software. Also, my sister can't seem to figure out how to run compatibility mode on her Windows 7 even though I printed out instructions from a forum for her, so maybe some computers can do it and others can't. If buying this with the intent to run it on compatibility mode, please keep in mind you are taking a chance.\",\n",
       " 'First things first: this is the greatest game I have ever played. Second: yes, this is the old DOS version that on its own probably won\\'t work on your computer. However, there is a ***free*** program called Exult that will allow you to play Ultima 7 on new versions of Windows, including Vista and Windows 7. But you *must* have Ultima 7 installed for it to work, because it has to access the game files, so you do have to own this game already to play. That being said... This game changed my mind about Ultima and about what games could accomplish in storytelling and scope. Going back about 15 years, I\\'d seen my friend play Ultima 4 and Ultima 6 at his house before and thought they looked okay, but it wasn\\'t until I played Ultima 7 that I really \"got\" it. Ultima 7--the Complete Ultima 7--is simply epic in every sense. You start out transporting into the town of Trinsic in Britannia, where your old pal Iolo is waiting and informs you that a ritualistic double murder has occurred in town, and your first task by order of the mayor of Trinsic is to investigate the crime scene, interview the townsfolk, and report back to him with your findings. So begins one of the most epic video games you will ever play. From there you will begin interviewing townsfolk, learn about recent events and attacks on the town, and begin learning about a religious organization called The Fellowship that seems to have taken Britannia by storm with its influence. The organization appears to have good intentions, but appearances can be deceiving, and it isn\\'t long before you are tasked by Lord British with joining The Fellowship so you can further investigate what goes on behind the scenes with The Fellowship and its charismatic, enigmatic, and inexplicably sinister leader, Batlin. And maybe figure out what the deal is with that big red face, otherwise known as The Guardian, who occasionally pops up on your screen and taunts you while you\\'re playing. And as you suspect, not all is what it seems with The Fellowship, and it is up to you to rescue Britannia from the threats within. Along the way you will spend innumerable hours taking in the ENORMOUS, living, breathing world of Britannia that Origin created. You will meet many companions for your party, some new and some old, and forge relationships with them through the clever, witty, and well-written dialog. You will meet the huge populace of the world, detailed to the extent that they all have their own houses, their own jobs, their own lives, and if you stand around and watch, you can see them engaging in all three over the course of each day. No, you won\\'t just see people in their shops 24/7 while you walk around on your quest. The people of Britannia will wake up in the morning, go to work, go to the local pub, come home and relax, and then sleep. They each have their own possessions, most of which you can take unless they have a locked chest and a hidden key. But going with the moral themes of the Ultima series, stealing items in front of other people will not only cause them to call the town guards on you, but steal enough and your companions will tell you they don\\'t agree with your morality anymore and they will leave you. Each town in Britannia is fully realized, with homes, pubs, shops, religious centers, and sometimes entertainment (such as the theater in Britain). Origin has also elected to give you the opportunity to participate in these enterprises. That\\'s right, if you\\'d like you can take a job with the baker in Britain and help him make loaf after loaf of fresh bread by literally mixing flour with water, rolling out the dough, putting it in the oven, and retrieving it. That is how ridiculously detailed Ultima 7 is. The world is big enough that you can easily get lost in the forest, mountains, or swamp if you stray from the dirt roads. However, this is often where you will run into the little hidden gems of Ultima 7, the random occurrences and hidden areas that you wouldn\\'t normally find. It is either in Part 1 or Part 2 where you may run into a lone house in the middle of the forest with a computer inside playing Ultima 8 and a dead pirate lying on the ground. If you click the computer either Iolo or Shamino say, with typical Ultima sarcasm, \"Ultima 8? Sounds about right, I\\'d say.\" And that is just Ultima 7 Part 1. Ultima 7 Part 2 takes place after the events of Part 1, thrusting you into the Serpent Isle with only Shamino, Dupre, and Iolo as company, and lucky you, as soon as you touch down a lightning teleportation storm hits and teleports all three companions elsewhere, leaving you alone. Your first order of business is to begin finding your friends and to continue chasing the villains from Part 1 (I don\\'t want to give away too much). But Serpent Isle has its own deal going on. The first city you encounter, Monitor, is a city of warriors; the only way to gain their trust and get them to actually help you is to pass their test of knighthood and become one of them. As you progress through Part 2, you will take on many more quests, meeting many more people and discovering many more plots in places like Fawn, the city of beauty, and Moonshade, a city full of mages. The core gameplay of Part 2 is the same as Part 1 and has the same sorts of cool stuff as I listed above. The graphics engine was updated a bit between Part 1 and Part 2, but not enormously. Finally, there are the two expansions to round out the package: the Forge of Virtue for Part 1 and the Silver Seed for Part 2. These are not integral to completing either game, but add a little more to the storyline and your experience in the game. You can ignore them if you choose. It really doesn\\'t matter. Bottom line: whether you are seeing Ultima 7 here as the Complete Ultima 7 or in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ultima-Collection/dp/B000028U20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ultima Collection</a>, it is more than worth your time. It is, as I said, the greatest game I have ever played, lovingly detailed to the most minute factor and easily addicting through its sheer vastness. This game will suck hours and hours out of your life, but at the end of it you will be glad you invested the time, because the gameplay will stick with you long after the Avatar saves the day yet again.',\n",

Add that to the fact that the seller did not even bother to blank out the character names on the screenshots, so Bliz will know which account is being sold.

One drawback is none of the goodies that came with these guides are in this collection, kind of a bummer really. Another drawback is the Twilight Princess guide isn't the 2008 re-release but instead the original 2007 release. A third drawback is that yes they are Prima guides and we all know how much they can leave out information.

A lot of the guides by themselves are selling $40-50 ea.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m not one to write a review, but I felt compelled to write one for this to help give people an idea of what to expect. I am an avid Zelda fan and a collector to a lesser extent. I have bought the hard cover collector\\'s edition Prima Guide for Zelda as far back as Twilight Princess and gotten nearly every one since. I had 4 of these books already, and 2 paperback books of the other 2 guides. So in a way I was buying a set of books I already had. Still has a collector and a fan, I could not pass it up and for me, I could not be happier I got this. In reading some other reviews about this item, I hope to clarify a few things about this set. 1. First off, I will say that my original set did come with a damaged chest. I got a replacement from Amazon, so no biggie and I\\'m not going to ding a star off for that. It was just bad packaging. 2. The metal book mark is fantastic, and better than I expected. The chest is nice and having the ribbon inside to help pull out the first book is a nice touch. Note it\\'s meant to just pull out ONE book at the back, which if you keep them in order should be Wind Waker HD. 3. As noted, this set does not come with the extra items such as cloth maps that the original individual books came with. Not a big deal to me, but it is what it is. What it does come with, and just that this set is a limited edition makes up for it to me. 4. I want to give a breakdown of these books and how they compare to the original individual ones I have, where applicable. - The Phantom Hourglass Guide is identical to the original lone book. - The Twilight Princess Guide IS The revised guide that apparently came out in 2007. I got my original when Twilight Princess came out and didn\\'t even know till I read the other reviews on here that there even was a revised edition. The 16 or so new pages are mostly a greatly expanded and more detailed \"legendary checklist\" at the back of the book. - Spirit Tracks: This one through me for a bit because the book in the set is about 1/4 an inch thicker than my original, but the contents and number of pages are identical so they must be using thicker paper. The only difference that I noticed is that the table of contents is the very last page of the book. I am honestly not sure if that is an error or intentional. - Ocarina of Time 3D. One of the books exclusive to this set and never available as a hard cover on it\\'s own. This is a very nice book and one of the reasons I wanted this book. In comparing in to my paper back version, the contents are the same but the page layouts are different here and there. - Skyward Sword. I did not get this one originally in hard cover, which was available on it\\'s own. But I have read and discovered it\\'s a greatly changed book from the original. It say it\\'s revised and expanded by over 100 pages, but in reading on Prima\\'s website the making of this set, they go into detail about how this book was basically rewritten by a new author and has all new screen shots. It\\'s much more than just expanded by 100 pages. This was my biggest surprise in this set, as I thought the Ocarina of Time book would be the only really unique book in this set, but it\\'s really that one and this one. - The Wind Waker HD. This book came out individually very recently so naturally the one in this set is identical to the stand alone. And that is about it. Like a said, a very great set and I am thrilled to own it.',\n",
       " \"This is a really nice collection, a must have for all Zelda fans. It just has some little details I didn't like: 1) My Ocarina of Time 3D guide is backwards, like they messed up when they bound the cover. It doesn't make it useless but it feels weird. 2) Why didn't they include space for the Link between worlds guide? It's a shame my copy of that guie has to be outside the chest. Everything else is great.\",\n",
       " \"This box is a must-have for any Zelda fan. Not only does it include 6 limited edition strategy guides with bonus content not available anywhere else, but it also comes with a beautiful golden etched bookmark and a certificate of authenticity with the limited number and message from the producer of the game. Each book ends up being about 20 dollars so the fact that it's all a limited release, the price is definitely worth it! As a Zelda fan, I would definitely recommend fans to go out and spend the money because you'll be sorry if you don't! If you're not a Zelda fan, well now's the time to become one!\",\n",

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks 3. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass 4. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD 5. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess 6. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (Expanded by 100 pages from the original guide) All of the books have gilded edges to give a gold sheen along each page. Most of these guides are out of print and hard to find. The guides are all the official Prima Games guides versions, which is a company dedicated to making video game strategy guide. As a result, the content is undoubtedly top notch in every guide to help you find every secret and defeat every boss.

Such as Ocarina Of Time's is purple....Why is it Purple? but it does have the original AND mirrored play though so that's good. It's in the shadow Temple, Spirit Temple Order.

I had left it closed until earlier today because I just had to hold the guides in hands. I took the plastic off and opened the chest. I was without a doubt worthy of 5 stars, that is until I look more closely. At first, I had only taken out the Wind Waker HD and spent 15 minutes preparing the spine for reading. When I was finished, I took out the next guide, Skyward Sword, and immediately saw a scratch on the upper backside of the spine. Upon further observations, I noticed that there were small dents near the bottom of the spine and even what appears to be some hot glue coming from the bottom of the binding. I was expecting something I would be fond of for years to come not something that would ruin my day the first day I were to open it. Pros: - best price - great themed case - love the style of the covers - loved the bookmark and letter of authenticity cons: - poor craftsmanship ruined my day Conclusion: It's an amazing product if and only if you don't mind what appears to be poor handling before distribution.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very quality collection of these hardcover strategy guides. I already owned all of them except the Ocarina of Time 3d guide, so I don't mind not getting the other things that came with the originals. Also, I'm not sure why other reviews have complained about this, collector's editions are collector's editions for a reason. If you wanted the extras, you should buy the original version of the CE guide. The metal bookmark that comes with these guides looks beautiful though it had a couple very small blemishes on the surface of one side. Magnetic lid closes nicely. The only thing I could want more in this is if it made the sound from the games of obtaining an important item from a chest when you opened it. That would make this complete. Great product!\",\n",
       " \"I was a bit disappointed that Prima didn't redo all their Guides and include them in this set. Just because the games are old doesn't mean they are not loved and well played to this day. It frustrates me that I now have other Prima guides sitting outside this box not in the cool collector's covers that don't fit this theme at all. I didn't take off for that though because I purchased this product knowing the older guides were not included so that wouldn't be fair. As far as what is included it is perfect! The chest is sturdy and will last forever if you take care of it and is just an awesome touch. The book covers are just so perfectly Zelda it is amazing. The Gold leafed pages are just showing off a bit but Gold is a main part of the Zelda theme so it fits even if it is a bit gaudy. The bookmark is epic and if it wasn't so big I would use it as an actual bookmark for everything I read I love it so much. The signed certificate is a very nice feature for collectors as well even if it was signed using a machine (no way that poor guy signed 50,000 of these things). The actual content of the guides is first rate. The are very complete, have wonderful pictures, and if you want to know how to get a specific item or sidequest or something it is in there. Wonderful product even if it is incomplete.\",\n",

The way the books slide out with a pull ribbon is a nice added touch, the gold book mark, the gilded pages of each book is stunning The down side is that it's so beautiful it's hard to want to use the books for strategy guides! It's very intimidating! I've heard this is the only way to get HD Windwaker guide and 3DS Ocarina of Time? So if that is true then that will be a selling point for players The treasure box is very adorable and the magnetic clasping is very nice I wouldn't recommend using the Zelda bookmark...as it might tarnish easily or get handling marks on it Even though a lot of the Prima guides don't flow well in some of the strategy : IE they leave parts out or forget to cover some events or omit some map layouts, I still recommend this for the visual appeal\",\n",

Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.

When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted. They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well. Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items.

The box that it comes in is thick cardboard. This set would have been PERFECT if it came in some sort of wooden crate. I would have been willing to pay extra for a deluxe version.

This set is just not good quality all around. Let\\'s start off with the bad: -All of the books have a huge scent of glue upon opening it, as well as \"goops\" of glue all around the binding clumping pages together. -Gild is already wearing off on some of the books upon opening the set -Badly bound - this is the biggest deal breaker here. It\\'s not sewn and it\\'s a \\'perfect binding\\' which is the least reliable of the sort. Pages will fall out with light use as has been the case with many, many books with this type of binding. -General scuffs around the books and bookmark - not up to \\'collector\\' standard, a lot of tiny scuffs here and there on all items inside. The Good: -The box (chest) feels very good, much better than other cardboard box sets. It feels nice and rigid for what it is. No problems there. -The game guides themselves provide great amount of content -The bookmark, besides the few little scuffs, is fantastic. Really nice. All in all, the binding is the biggest deal breaker for me. It is basically just a paperback glued to a hardcover and provides no real advantage over paperbacks. Pages falling out with ease is not my definition of a collector\\'s set and definitely would not pay the asking price for it.',\n",

The walkthroughs are in depth, and perfect for someone who is stuck, wanting to 100% complete the game, or just for a collector's item. I also love the golden design of the bookmark. It is glossy and serves its purpose well. The chest is handy for holding all these guides, and serves as a nice showpiece.

As i've gotten older it's been harder to enjoy Zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i don't have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade. The golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from Wind Waker. The guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through.

       " \"This is absolutely fantastic. When I picked up the amazon box at the door, I was taken by surprise by its weight...perhaps I should've looked at that in the description! I gently opened it and unsnapped the magnetic seal to reveal a gorgeous gold-plated bookmark with etched logos. The hardcover guides are beautiful with gilded edges and he certificate of authenticity is nicely tucked away in an envelope. As others have said, it would be nice if they included room for A Link Between Worlds, but it's not that big a deal. If you are a diehard Zelda fan, GET THIS WHILE YOU CAN!\",\n",
       " 'Arrived in some very secure packaging from Prima themselves. Overall it is what I expected except for a few small things: 1. None of the bonus maps/posters/bookmarks that originally came with the Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, or Spirit Tracks guides are included. 2. One highly usual thing is that the Twilight Princess guide is a reprint of the original one from 2006 and not the revised edition from 2007 which had 16 more pages of expanded content. Seems like a really weird move to not have used that revised edition for this boxset. 3. And finally, why no space for the Link Between Worlds guide? Would have been great since that came out at the same time.',\n",
       " \"I cannot express to you how happy I am to have received such an amazing box set. The Legend of Zelda has always been a very special franchise to me, and I could not pass the opportunity up when I saw this item. I really cannot say much more than the other 5-star reviews already have, but wow, what a great steal. BUY THESE BOOKS NOW. Seriously, right now. The price listed here on Amazon is unbeatable, and the prices will surely go up. I paid just shy of $18 for each book considering the total price I ended up paying (oh yeah, and free shipping). This is BEFORE all of the other features of the set, such as the sturdy bookmark, certificate of authenticity, and chest container. I think it is very well worth it by all standards. Now, my set had only a few minor flaws that I felt should be pointed out but do not subtract my overall score because they are, as I mentioned, relatively minor. My bookmark has several small scratches on the back of it that I had noticed directly after I had pulled it out. It's a shame... It's quite a nice looking bookmark. Another thing to note is the fact that some of the golden gilded pages were not entirely, well, gilded. There were a few spots on various books that had tiny amounts of the golden paint missing. Where it is lacking, the edges look slightly darker than the surrounding area. Overall, just a tad bit disappointing, but nothing that will make me disregard the amazing features of the entire set. I love these game guides and hope to find ones more like them in the future.\",\n",
       " \"Great set for any Zelda fan. Although I am sad that the maps that came with the first prints weren't included it is still fantastic set!\",\n",
       " \"This collection is OUTSTANDING in terms of quality and appearance. Over the years, I have purchased most of these guides and got the additional materials that were included with them (though these were not replicated for the guides in this collection unfortunately). If ever you were looking for a nice collection of books concerning The Legend of Zelda or to aid in completing the games, this set is DEFINITELY for you. PROS: 1) Quality: The outer box resembles a treasure chest, the likes of which Link finds all across Hyrule (and many other worlds connected to it). It is a sturdy cardboard coated with a gloss-like finish, and it seems to have a magnetic clasp built in to keep the top closed. On the roof of the top, when opened, is a slot containing a metallic (yes, metallic, not vinyl or cardboard) bookmark that has been beautifully etched by what appears to be laser. It contains the logo of the series on one side and the crest of the Royal Family of Hyrule on the other, making for a very attractive (and unexpectedly greater quality) bookmark. The books themselves all appear to be of slightly better quality than their original prints (which had binding problems and easily tore in some instances). 2) Additional Goodies: The most obvious additional item (and most sought after in time I am sure) would be the guide for Ocarina of Time 3D, which is only available through this set (of which only 50,000 exist). I have examined it, and it is a VERY nice guide for the game, and as beautifully put together as its companion guides. Another obvious extra is the metallic bookmark, which is really one of the nicest bookmarks I have seen honestly. Also, something else extra that may be easy to miss is this: some of the materials in this print of the guides have been expanded upon (the number of pages in Skyward Sword's guide has increased by 100 if that tells you anything). 3) Collectible Status: The set comes with a certificate of authenticity that includes a stamped number out of 50,000 and with the printed message and signature of Eiji Aonuma. It marks the set as one out of 50,000 which indicates its collectible status and will almost certainly indicate an increase in value as time goes on. 4) Packaging: I have NEVER seen such good packaging for any item I have bought online as I have for this one. The box the collection was shipped in is a good middle size containing two foam-like holding pieces that fit onto each end of the chest/box which hold it in place (and suspend it both above the shipping box's bottom and below the shipping box's top) and ensures that the package will not move around inside the shipping box at all during transport. I intend to keep the shipping box and packaging the collection came in to transport it again when I am ready to move. You can definitely rest assured that the collection will not suffer damage during shipping. CONS: 1) Lack of Previous Additional Materials: As indicated before, the previous materials included with the previous print of these guides were not included, nor the map from the recently released Wind Waker HD guide. This is a small complaint, as Twilight Princess's guide originally came with a cloth map of Hyrule, the Phantom Hourglass guide came with a vinyl bookmark of its own, and the Spirit Tracks guide originally came with a printed map of Hyrule. While this is a regrettable exclusion, one should also take note that those materials were fairly cheaply made. Hence, you're not missing out on much in that regard. 2) Exclusion of ALBW Guide: It is a shame that the makers of the collection did not have the foresight to include the recently released collector's guide for A Link Between Worlds in this collection, and considering they came out basically at the same time they easily could have. This is a minor complaint, as the guide for A Link Between Worlds is of course available for purchase and comes with a collector's lithograph of the primary image from A Link Between Worlds. Still, it would have been nice to have gotten them all together in one fell swoop, though of course this would have increased the size and weight of the package even more than it already is (and trust me, it weighs a good amount). BOTTOM LINE: This is an AWESOME set that will make any collector ecstatic to possess for not only its vast wealth of knowledge concerning the games it covers, but also for its beauty, craftsmanship and quality. If you have not already gotten these guides, I STRONGLY encourage you to pick up this set while you are able to (there are only 50,000 in existence). And if you have already gotten some of these guides as I had, I encourage you to still pick up this set and possibly sell your older copies as I plan to. I plan to keep the extras that came with the previous printings of the guides and sell the guides themselves, as I now have this collection and no longer have any need for them. The mere inclusion of the Ocarina of Time 3D guide (which apparently is not going to be released outside this set according to the publishers) alone should be a pretty good reason to get this collection, and after seeing it in person, I couldn't agree more that it was indeed worth it.\",\n",
       " 'Just got my set today and it is wonderful! The magnetic chest looks very nice, and the metallic bookmark is gorgeous! The gilded pages are beautiful and I love the hylian symbol on the front. The only defect (for me anyway) is the spirit tracks guide. The cover was either bound wrong to the pages, the pages were bound wrong to the cover, or the gold details on the front were put upside down - as when you hold the guide upright or what should be the \"upside\" based on the hylian symbol, the pages are upside-down and facing to the right! I still love the set though and the others are fine. But it is weird opening the guide and having either the pages or the hylian symbol upside down lol',\n",
       " 'A must have collection for any hardcore Zelda fan. Nicely put together hardcover books with certificate and metallic bookmark as well.',\n",
       " 'Unlike the packing for the seperate collectors guides(crappy amazon book envelopes that get into bear fights with ups and ends up on your doorstep in \"used\" condition) this set comes protected to the hilt and looks great.

       " 'High quality magnetic chest box! This is so gorgeous and would be an excellent gift for any Zelda lover! Hurry and get your copy before they run out. Only 50k were made!',\n",
       " 'Came packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything. I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I\\'ve heard that the quality for them were not that great. The bookmark and certificate all make up for it, also the \"chest\" the items came in. For $107, this is a bargain! The books separately are at least $30 each. This is a perfect LoZ collectors item.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games. My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately. I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.\",\n",
       " 'this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!',\n",
       " \"This is an amazing edition to and Zelda fan's collection. I don't understand why they didn't either a)leave a spot for the link between worlds guide or b)include it in the bundle. Especially since it was released at the same time as the game\",\n",
       " \"JUST AMAZING! I didn't expect each guide to come with the special maps or extras that went with them on the original prints. I just knew I was getting guides, a fancy bookmark and fancy box. This is the set for the die hard. I'm super excited and glad I purchased this!\",\n",
       " \"In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item. For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it. Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well. For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun. For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy. There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold. It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide. With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart. The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon. Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases. There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest. When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there. The covers all look very similar. Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them. The covers and the borders are different on each guide. The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD. All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves. The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped. This seems a little odd. It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose. Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange. Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras. Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here. Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package. So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck. That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides. The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide. Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide. Ever. This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover. Originally the guide was only in paperback. This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here. This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published. It has been revised and expanded. Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself. It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages. It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released. So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals. Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide. The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns. Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns. It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result. Much of the text isn't so cramped. Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier. It just looks better and more organized overall. The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking. The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes. Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped. In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location. Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required. The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases. The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well. So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes. Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note. The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered. The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark. For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal. It's invaluable. The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with. It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package. Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy. But let's be clear. If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves. After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy. They are a collector's item. And it is certainly a nice one.\",\n",
       " \"I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!\",\n",

       " 'Every now and again, a simulation comes along that commands respect by delivering variable degrees of realism coupled with really good AI (Artificial Intelligence) and lots of replayability. Aces Of The Deep is one of them. More than 10 years after its release, I find myself returning to it again and again, and I never seem to tire of it. Why? Well, AOTD is blessed with a good design...good graphics for its time (640x480x256 colors), good AI, an easy-to-use interface, and very few bugs. Nothing ruins your gaming fun like having it crash just as you\\'re whipping your AI opponent\\'s butt, but this has never been much of a problem with AOTD. Speaking of the AI opponent, the AI in this game, at the higher \"realism\" levels, is good enough to hunt you down and depth-charge you to pieces. Still, I find enemy destroyers are vulnerable to down-the-throat torpedo shots. It\\'s a good tactic to practice and it has saved my butt many times. Aces Of The Deep is very historically accurate. When the war starts, you are Kapitain of a slow & weak Type-II sub. As the war progresses and you & your crew gain experience & survive patrols, more powerful sub designs and better torpedoes become available. Also, as the war progresses, the Allied sub-hunters (surface ships and planes) get better and better at hunting you down and sending you plunging to Davey Jones Locker. The first version of Aces Of The Deep was the DOS/Diskette version. An expansion disk was later released which added the Mediterranean Sea theatre and also patched several known bugs. The \"Command\" version -- \"Aces Of The Deep: Command\" -- is CD-based and runs natively on Win95/98. AOTD Command includes both the orignal AOTD missions as well as the expansion/add-on missions, it rubs smoother and crashes less than the DOS version, AND it includes voice-recognition, which allows the player to use a microphone to command his U-Boat crew. Whichever version of AOTD you buy, I guarantee that you\\'re in for quite a gaming experience, playing a deadly game of cat & mouse under the cold, unforgiving waves of the North Atlantic. Good luck Kaptain, you\\'ll need it.',\n",
       " \"First of all- why is this under books? Last time I looked it was a computer game, and a pretty good one as well. The plot is unoriginal- humans create super intellegent cyborgs to fight for us, but they turn against us. Thi is where you, as an expert fighter, come in. The game sees you driving and flying armored robots in an effort to save the world. There is a range of types of missions. Sometimes it is to defend a base against an attack, on other occasions it is to guard a particualr strategic site or a HERC holding a particular technology advance, all of which should be familiar if oyu've played this type of gaem before. For its age the graphics aren't too bad, with a range of terrain portrayred well and reasonable detail on the HERCS and buildings. You have three team-mates, who you can issue intructions to during a mission, such as to attack a particular target or defend a particular location. It is also prudent to protect these, as if they die they are replaced by rookies without as much fighting efficiency. But the game is now 5 years old, and understandably it can't match more recent releases. The video sequences are technologically behind, but are only used as mission briefings (brief being the operative word). Many gameplay innovations are absent, and for sheer thrill factor it is lacking. Still good if you find it on the cheap, but not a real contender these days\",\n",

       " \"The Editor in Chief A1 software is based on the workbook of the same name. Each lesson includes a short newspaper-style article, and it's up to the player to locate and identify all the grammatical errors the article contains. Unlike the workbook, in which one must identify only where errors are present and how to solve them, the software adds an extra step: You must actually identify precisely what the error is by choosing a description of the flaw from a wide variety of specific categories within the arenas of punctuation, sentence structure, grammar, parts of speech, and the like. (i.e., is the problem that the wrong verb tense was used? Was it an incomplete sentence? Was such-and-such punctuation/word used in the wrong place? Was there an excess of commas or too few? and many other specific descriptions.) It can be frustrating when you know where an error is, but can't figure out what specific category to place it in. Some kids will take in in stride, but others are prone to get quite annoyed. If this is the case, you may want to look at the lesson with your child and help them through the process of categorizing the error. When you finish a lesson, you can play a spelling game where you shoot words with a pencil. Not exactly insanely fun, but a refreshing break, and it's nice that it's still semi-educational. Overall, if you're teaching grammar for approximately Grades 4-5, Editor in Chief A1 is a good choice. It's challenging, more engaging than a workbook, but definitely a strictly educational program; not swamped with fun, games and animation, but nonetheless pleasant to use.\",\n",

       " \"This is a really useful tool to learn meditation and quieting the mind in the midst of an active stimulating environment. The whole point is that you're racing a car and trying to beat other computer controlled cars around the track. With the skin conductance and heart rate monitor (which attaches to your fingertips) you control the car's speed. You increase your speed by slowing down your breathing, heart rate, and skin conductance and getting into a meditative state. Yet the faster you make your car go the louder the music becomes and the more exciting the games gets (i.e. the competition with other cars and drive to achieve the goal of finishing the race increases). And thus the better you do at racing the car the harder it gets to increase its speed due to the increasing difficulty of relaxing. This is directly applicable to test anxiety which is aided by learning to relax even in stressful situations. However, if you are new to biofeedback (or don't have a lot of practice) consider starting with a program such as Healing Rhythms first. Dual Drive Pro is VERY challenging and takes practice before you can succeed. It may be discouraging at first, which isn't ideal when learning relaxation. Part of the difficulty though is also part of the appeal as the game is incredibly sensitive and gives almost instant feedback on the slightest increase in tension or excitation. It's fun.\",\n",

       " \"This game was never really a fan favourite. I can see why, but it's also clear to me why it was one of my cherished games as a late teen. The collective of writers, graphic artists and composer(s) in Bloodnet are nothing short of brilliant when it comes to setting a particular mood. I would label this unique mood as urban-dystopian-futuristic-cyberpunk-gothic-mystic that ends up being both oppressive and enchanting at the same time, quite a feat. It's amazing what Microprose can bring out of the dedicated player with little more than a mixture of pre-rendered and handdrawn futuristic stills and peculiar midi music to match. Especially back as a teen, Bloodnet's distinctive atmosphere engulfed my very spirits and managed to linger around me even when I was not actually playing it. Few games (or movies, or books) are capable of this as it takes a certain kind of giftedness, one that this staff happened to possess. VTM: Bloodlines comes to mind, and a couple of others. I also like the fact that Bloodnet is a game of alloys: alloying classic adventure with RPG, distant future with Medieval vampire myths, a bright and loud metropolis with a dark and silent mystery, a detailed and possible future with implausible supernatural goings-on. This aspect was accomplished well. On the bad side, the game feels like it is not interested in letting us actually play it, but only showing off its great graphics, ambient music and, above all, writing. At the same time, it has high ambitions of attempting to merge the genres of point-and-click adventure and strictly stat-based RPG. The end result is a weird mishmash of endless conversations, heavy turn-based combat, and wandering about on motionless landscapes. Weirdness can be a good and a bad thing, and in this case it's both. Part of the appeal, I think (at least for me). My biggest beef with the overall experience is the pre-scripted, absolutely non-interactive dialogs. Again, the sprawling, gritty conversations in this game are masterfully written and are more memorable than the ones in most big-time movies I've seen, but leaving them non-interactive is the biggest deal-breaker, a missed chance for an additional layer of depth and player involvement. Bloodnet is not a good game. It feels static and almost non-interactive. It is, however, a good experience. So good that it ended up as one of the very few games from the early 90's that I actively revisit from time to time. The ultimate praise I can give the game, I think, is that it is a spiritual and atmospheric precursor to the Deus Ex series and VTM: Bloodlines, which are of course much better games, but Bloodnet holds its own against them in terms of mood, writing and originality. No small feat for a 1993 DOS game.\",\n",

The expansion makes the overlord more deadly, which I like because I enjoy being the overlord, and adds on just enough to keep the game going. Not a bad expansion to get if you want to extend the life of Descent. The other thing is the quality of the pieces.

The philosophy behind this system says that while roleplaying may have evolved from 1970s tabletop miniatures wargaming, roleplaying rules shouldn\\'t always play like a Napoleonic battlegame with roleplaying elements grafted on. FATE\\'s ethic eschews crunchy, one-hex-on-the-battle-mat-equals-five-feet wargaming rules in favor of a quick, easy system which focuses on how the players\\' actions impact overall story and plot. It\\'s a radical departure from first- and second-generation roleplaying games, but it\\'s an approach which holds a lot of appeal for me personally-- even if it might not be for everyone.

       " \"The Fate Freeport Companion offers a great setting (who doesn't love a fantasy pirate theme?), however, the reworked skillset kind of limits the game somewhat. It seems like every other creature or NPC has a main stat that is great (+4 to rolls) or better for combat. This is countered by them not being able to take consequences like your character can, but it makes combat encounters pretty much a straight forward affair and the game is obviously based off a D20 type playstyle. D20 is great for what it is, a crunchy rule system for straight combat systems with little room for sway, however the Fate system is way more story focused and is about applying your characters strengths and weaknesses in unique ways. Combat and dice rolls are a very small part of the Fate Core experience and the Fate Freeport Companion seems to miss this concept. I still like the FFC because of the world, the characters, the ideas, and the overall concept and I can appreciate that Brian Engard and Clark Valentine were trying to combine these two systems in a way that made for a kind of 'common ground' feel, but it isn't freeform enough for one (Fate) and not rule specific enough for the other (D20). If a retread were attempted to remove the more crunchy elements and the system were to focus on the pure Fate aspects of the city and gaming sessions, I could easily recommend this as must have for a resource book for people wanting a fleshed out fantasy setting for Fate sessions. As it is right now though, I wouldn't recommend this book for Fate fans or D20 fans on the whole. If you are looking for settings for a Fate game, the Fate Worlds books are a better value in that they give you a setting, a general concept of what is going on, examples of characters, main players, etc. while leaving enough open for you to customize your gaming sessions and I feel they are much better values for your money and time. That said, I really do hope this setting is revisited and more refined for the Fate system because it is a very, very nice setting and I will still be pulling stuff out of it for my gaming sessions, but I would recommend newer players avoid this book because the skill change and combat heavy elements might turn you away from what Fate is all about.\",\n",

The intrigue and role playing that it brings is amazing and I was worried when purchasing this product. Needless to say, I was very pleased. As always the components from Fantasy Flight are durable and all accounted for. The book was also quite hefty coming in around 190 pages.

It contains some great images of weapon schematics to give GMs and players a better idea of what it is they will be getting their hands on. It's new rule sets are a little vague on occasion, but that's fairly normal for such an abstract narrative focus game. 2. Content This is a GREAT. Book for medium-heavy combat oriented groups. Even if a group isn't focused in such a way, the resources provided here are largely helpful to ideas on theme. It also helps detail mercenary groups who may be working against the PCs, so even if a GMs players aren't currently focusing on getting into big trouble, trouble may find them. It also helps lay out the RP elements for prospective Hired Guns and other mercenary types that do not conform to the class. It has a large selection of new near-military grade weapons, explosives (for which new rules have been outlined) and assault ships. 3. Complaints One or two introduced elements are incredibly overpowered or, at the very least, raise difficult questions about their limitations. One of the mods in particular allows players to fire a weapon without using hands but does not identify whether it counts as a second or even third weapon in the case of attacking. But really the biggest problem with both class books so far has been the infamous signature abilities. These range from nearly useless to absolutely narrative breaking, inducing instant, unstoppable mass-slaughter or near invincibility in the case of the HG.

I play with my 23 yo son who understands the strategy better than I do - so, between games, I am learning with this software which is very user friendly. Since this is a game that will take a life-time to learn, I find that the software gives me patient learning that the even the lowest ranked on-line players can\\'t give me - including the time to think things over and take back dumb moves. If you want to learn the game of GO - BEWARE, it is VERY adicting. Try the free 9 x 9 version to learn the basics. Then graduate to this program.

Only two complaints: 1)When taking a test there\\'s no \"counter\" visible, so you don\\'t have a clue how many puzzles you still have to go (I like the way other programs of theirs - like \"Intermediate Tactics\" give information like \"#5 of 50\"). 2)When you make a few mistakes, a small window opens up, showing you a similar position as the one you\\'re trying to solve, which you can practice on, but... where the \"main puzzles\" have the (option of showing the) color you\\'re playing at the bottom of the board, these small \"help boards\" always show the position from the White side.

Second, chess combinations are well tested, and one can check his or her own solution using the built in Craft chess engine.

Additionally, it offers exceptional value for your money providing 100s of hour of valuable training for a very modest price. General comment on Tactical Training: Mastering the Tactical training consists of fast and accurate recognition of standard tactical ideas (motifs) and ability to calculate. Your training should be split in two parts - learning the motifs and then improving you ability to calculate. In the early positions you will have to go through simple 1-2 moves tactics involving double attack, deflection, attraction, and other basic tactical motifs. As you progress - you will have to deal with multiple tactical ideas, longer variations and more resourceful defense. The rating you get is more generous than it should have been, but nevertheless a good indicator of your progress. This tool is ideal for practicing!

(On any time control of an hour or less per game, any of the top 5 chess programs dominates Kramnik and Topalov, the 2nd best human chess player. Where the (world grandmaster strong engine) comes in handy is not in playing against it, (A most frustrating endeavor to be sure), but in helping a player \"see\" what the engine is thinking. No human or even chess program can play perfectly, but today\\'s top engines come pretty darn close, as Kramnik can attest to. You can of course tweak the engine to play weaker, but one bad point of Fritz is when it \"dumbs down\" it\\'s engine, it does so at the expense of realistic play. I.E. leaving a piece en prise, which doesn\\'t happen often even among \"mere\" experts. at slow time controls. The user interface on Fritz 10 however is very user friendly. The browser like icons on top of the picture is one example. If you\\'re not sure what an icon is for, just hover the mouse over them and it will tell you. Everything is customizable from the look and feel of the board to the sounds, even to such minute details like the look of the fonts on the notation. All very intuitive. There is an updated database (to 9/06) which includes the controversial Topalov-Kramnik match. You can search among 1,100,000 games by name, opening, position, even endgame pieces. You can play some historical games by such great players like Fischer and Capablanca, and you can see how many \"inaccuracies\" they made. And brilliant moves as well. But for me, the best part of Fritz 10 or any chessbase compatible chess program, is the play server. That alone is worth the price of the program. It\\'s simply the best place to play. At this server, you also get to watch grandmasters play blitz and whenever there is a big tourney like Linares or a world championship match you can watch every move LIVE. And unlike most chess servers, here all your games are kept on a separate database that you played online, and study them with the help of your world class analysis partner, Fritz. This is very long I realize but I haven\\'t come close to touching on all the features like training modes, 3-D graphics, chess variants like giveaway and chess 960, importing chess books etc. If you have Fritz 9 and your one year subscription to it\\'s playchess server has not yet expired, then perhaps you don\\'t need to get Fritz 10. But if you\\'re anyone else who plays chess and loves following the games of great players, then you won\\'t go wrong with Fritz 10.',\n",
       " \"If you're new to chessbase engines, Fritz is absolutely the one to get. It has all the features you want: great database, an engine you can customize to your level, great analysis function, a computer that can beat the socks off you if you need it. And of course, the program is designed ideally for Fritz. If you go for one, only get Fritz. Here's what I thought about some of the new features: The 3d improvements are great for a few games. Then you go back to 2D because it's still easier. I've run this program against several others on my computers. It matches well against Rybka and is superior to everything else. If you already own another recent chessbase engine, though, you won't find anything really new here.\",\n",
       " 'Fritz 10 is the latest and greatest version of the German chess program put out by ChessBase, a specialist in chess database and playing software. It boasts a set of new features and improvements over its predecessor, and all indicators suggest that it delivers. That said, Fritz 10 may or may not be a wise purchase, depending on why you want it. I will start off by saying that if you are interested in this package as a playing partner and you already have a very strong chess engine to spar with, Fritz 10 is likely a waste of money for you. As another reviewer stated, the engine is so strong that it will crush all but the top grandmasters in the world, so casual play will be frustrating for hobbyists. However, if you want it because you plan to do some serious analysis work and you want the latest engine, it is worth more consideration, though there are stronger engines such as Shredder and Hiarcs. Fritz 10 does a nice job of automatically analyzing games, adding some natural language notations with the move notations, although it is debatable whether or not these notations are very useful. The improvements over its predecessor are mainly in the GUI, not the engine (although the engine shows some promising improvements as well but does not drastically demonstrate strength over its predecessor, Fritz 9). There are some new training features such as showing the engine\\'s plans, which is a solid tool in the toolbox when trying to improve. The sparring and friend modes are also very helpful, though I must concur with the previous reviewer in that the engine makes some silly moves when you \"dumb it down\" to meet the player\\'s skill level. The graphics ability of this package are much improved, offering better piece rendering and display. This is not necessarily a very important feature unless you like your eye candy. As a UCI client, ChessBase seems to have ironed out the problems of the past. The GUI even seems to have a fairly good idea of how strong imported engines are, which is made clear when playing rated games. In testing a few imported engines, Fritz 10 did well in managing these engines and everything was stable. Updates to the PlayChess interface include weather reporting. I have to ask: How useful is this in a chess program? Overall, Fritz 10 is a very nice package and is worth the money if you want a strong program that can analyze games and can connect you to other players on the net. There are stronger engines out there (and some of them are free downloads) so if you are looking for the very best engine on the market, this isn\\'t it. Also, if you have an earlier version and you want it because it\\'s \"the latest and greatest\" in the hopes of getting a hugely improved playing engine, you\\'ll probably be disappointed. However, if you want pretty graphics and an intuitive interface or if you are looking for a good training tool that can help you to understand your game a little better, Fritz 10 is a good choice.',\n",
       " \"I'd love to be here giving it a great review, seeing as I wanted a chess program that Fritz advertises itself as being, but Amazon is pretty much selling a worthless DVD. I have to register everytime I use this DVD. I have to remove the whole program and then re-register everytime I want to use it. What's the freakin point of including a registration number that won't work? Basically, I have a $20 cup coaster. Yeah, this isn't exactly a review of the program, so take it for what it is, but beware of the trash you're likely to receive.\",\n",
       " 'Been trying to play this program for about two weeks. Everything about it seems overly complicated yet poorly programmed. Difficulty levels seem to vary wildly no matter what settings you choose and the tournament games keep freezing up.

Tried doing the online update to see if this would fix the problems and the update kept crashing whenever I tried to install it. Very frustrating.',\n",
       " 'Plenty of features and I wouldn\\'t be without it. It was easy to install Rybka as my engine of choice. But ...

Instead you get the last game you looked at.',\n",
       " 'I am not going to write a book here because a lot of the others have done a good job in explaining the software. What i wanted to say is that this game teaches,is controlable, looks great, and is good for at anyones level. If you are going to buy a Chess Program this is the one to buy. You will learn alot for sure.',\n",
       " 'Fritz is arguably the most commercially-successful and popular chess package available. I started using Fritz at version 6 and have purchased most of the upgrades, up to version 10. With each successive version the whole package has gotten better and better though some of the upgrades were more worthwhile than others (one reason I never purchased version 11). Version 12 is a quantum leap forward, though it is still not perfect. Installation from the DVD was painless and uneventful. However, there is one issue with the installation that bothered me - the installer never installed a desktop icon or a program group, so I needed to navigate to the installation directory, from which I made a shortcut to the application binary on the desktop. After this step, everything has worked smoothly and I can launch the application without issue. The interface has gotten a huge facelift - this is not a color scheme change or rearrangement of the menus and toolbars, but rather it is a complete overhaul with Windows ribbon controls serving up the components. Normally, I would be wary of such a large change to the overall interface, but ChessBase has done an excellent job of designing the interface and it is very well-organized. There is a learning curve, though, for people who have grown very accustomed to the older ChessBase interface, as some things are a little difficult to find unless you have familiarity... Given a couple of hours of exploration, the interface becomes second nature and finding things becomes easy again. The Fritz engine itself is a strong one, able to crush practically any human player (including seasoned grandmasters) with ease when used at full playing strength and it holds its own against other top-drawer engines. It is not the strongest engine available, but for the vast majority of players it doesn\\'t need to be the strongest. When using an engine this strong, playing against it is not the most useful activity; where engines of this strength are most useful is in the analysis of games. Fritz includes several analysis modes, my favorite being full analysis for post-mortem scrutiny of games. The full analysis function works backward through a game and adds move suggestions as well as canned commentary as the selected chess engine evaluates each position. Though the English commentary is not always especially informative (for example, comments like \"This is a futile try to save the game\" are common), the comments do add a more \"personal\" touch to the analysis which would otherwise be simply a dump of suggested moves. When the engine finds an especially good move, the commentary is usually a little more helpful. I found an annoying glitch with the Full Analysis mode. After fully analyzing a game, the interface simply chopped the last quarter of the game from the report, even though I could still iterate through all of the moves. I never could get the rest of the analysis on the screen. Another very helpful analysis mode is \"Infinite Analysis\" which takes a single position and continuously analyzes it until the engine is interrupted or the position is changed. This is especially helpful for taking a deep look at a position and trying several what-if scenarios. Deep position analysis is another mode, as is Monte Carlo, though I have used these so little that I cannot really comment on them. The last analysis mode I will talk about is \"Engine Shootout\" which takes a position and feeds it to two or more engines for analysis. These engines evaluate the position and play through, with the intent of determining how the game would proceed and the outcome as a result. Though it\\'s a feature I really don\\'t need, it is something I use occasionally to look at games I have played when the game was unfinished but the outcome wasn\\'t clear. Different engines arrive at different conclusions which makes this even more intriguing. The Fritz package includes a large database of games, which can be used to explore and analyze. Where I find this database to be most useful is in researching specific styles of play. For example, it is easy to track down all of Tal\\'s games and follow his playing style with the database search functions. Also included on the DVD is a set of training videos. To be honest I have never found these to be especially helpful but others may very well benefit from them. The UCI interface continues to improve, so adding in UCI engines is easy and reliable. I have found several weaker engines against which I can play so I have them bound into the interface for playing. I use the Fritz 12 engine for analysis after the fact. Central to the Fritz interface is access to the ChessBase chess server. Through the interface, players can log into the server, play games, read chess-related news, watch seminars, and observe important matches with live coverage. There are a couple of different versions to this package. The version sold by ChessBase and its resellers sports a green box whereas the version sold through Viva Media comes in a black box. I noticed an appreciable price difference and I investigated that difference. The software appears to be the same; the real difference is in the access given to the chess server. The more expensive package offers a 1-year premium membership which gives access to all content on the server such as seminars, elite tournament coverage and other content. The less expensive package also offers a 1-year membership but the access is more limited and excludes much of the premium content. Both offer guest access which allows anyone to log in and play games without hindrance, but as a guest so there is no tracking of progress. Which kind of access you desire should be considered when choosing which package you need. Fritz 12 is a big step forward and is a worthwhile upgrade from previous versions. The engine is stronger and the interface is vastly superior. It is not without its glitches but the problems seem to be few in number.',\n",
       " 'After I installed the program and played a game and closed the game window there was no way to play again. No icon on the desktop or any play function in the installed game in the computer. Re-installing did not work. Contacted the manufacturer and heard nothing back.',\n",
       " 'This game is the best chess program out there that I know of. It plays excellent chess and the pieces look nice. However, when you move the ELO slide to the minimum, it plays really hard, about 1100 ELO rating. I played it at this level using Online Chess Kingdom and Chess master (PSP games) at the highest level vs. fritz set to the min level, and so they lost to fritz. It was easy to tell Fritz wasn\\'t playing at 1100 ELO, but closer to 2000. The PS3 version of Fritz doesn\\'t have this shortcoming, you feel drastic changes at different ELO ratings, but this computer version you don\\'t feel much ELO change. Another shortcoming is that the game freezes if you choose the \"render light\" option, it slows down significantly if you improve all the graphics in the option menu, and the game flashes once in a while. Some windows don\\'t close despite they have the \"x\". The clicking sound can be deactivated, but it takes some googling time to find out how. On the positive site, the sense of humor is a unique touch, since playing chess can get really quiet. This game could use more chess sets and picture wall papers like in Chess Master. Everything else, I wouldn\\'t change.',\n",

       " 'As a very casual chess player, I decided to give Fritz 12 a try. The program is smart enough to obliterate just about anyone, but you can play the game at several different difficulty levels. It even has a friend mode where the computer determines how strong a chess player you are and plays at close to your level. This is one tough opponent - even in the friend mode. There are also several \"personalities\" you can play against. Each personality has preprogrammed strengths and weaknesses (including how badly it blunders). You can also change several of their attributes to make them a stronger or weaker player. Fritz 12 is packed with training tools. You can set the game up so it suggests opening moves; warns you if a square you are about to move to is under attack; give you hints or suggested moves; tell you what your opponent is planning to do; and much more. The free beginner training videos are good. There are also several sample videos for other topics included, in hopes you decide to purchase additional training videos. Even at full price this is a terrific training tool and should certainly help you improve your game, even though you may get a bit frustrated if you like to win.',\n",

To register, I entered the product serial number from the label inside the case and the validation code displayed in the licensing dialog box. (NOTE: This step could have clearer instructions I suppose, because it took me two tries to get it. The first try, I just entered the serial number and clicked OK. That resulted in an error message but the program ran anyway. The second time I ran the app I again got the licensing dialog box, and again entered the serial number, but this time realized that the dialog box was displaying a code in large funky letters.

I totally agree with all the excellent things other reviewers have said, but do consider this: On June 10, 2011, World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand told Chessvibes.com his preferred engine was Houdini over both Rybka and Fritz. Deep Fritz 13 (not 12) now has Houdini 3 installed into it and is the ultimate way to prepare for an OTB tournamemnt by weeding out any inconsistencies in your favorite openings. Deep Fritz 12 is still important however since you can install the free Houdini 1.5 download (ELO 3250) or the Houdini 3 Pro version (current CCRL rating 3347) in the Fritz engine management tab under the:\"create a UCI engine\" option. Why is a high ELO rating so important?Because when you go to your next OTB tournament, rest assured at least one of your opponents will have his openings down pat with many new ideas and all inconsistancies worked out well in advance and approved by the worlds strongest engine which is Houdini. If you prefer to rely on the weak main lines and sloppy analysis found in both the \"Secrets of Opening Surprises\" or \"Dangerous Weapons\" books then you may learn the hard way (as I did)by losing many games after reaching terrible positions during the critical opening stages of the game. So I agree with all the good things said about Deep Fritz 12, but its really the excellent GUI(Graphic User Interface) provided that makes Fritz invaluable in creating a truly powerful opening arsenal that will give your opponents something to think about.',\n",

To test this further I set up a 12 game head to head tournament with Stockfish and one processor Fritz 12 tied four processor Stockfish 6-6. This won me over. I use Fritz 12 to analyze games almost exclusively. The major disappointment was the Fritz trainer samples which were cut down to about 2 and one half minutes each.

       " 'I had been using the older Chessbase Light 2009 (free, but read-only) as well as the even older version of Chessbase Light (free and write-enabled but limited to 8,000 game DBs). Also I used the free SCIDvsPC. I have started taking chess lessons over the phone using a screen sharing program and my instructor uses Chessbase for his lesssons and homework assignments. After my introductory lessons it was clear that I needed a full version of Chessbase. It is the most expensive of the commerical database programs but it is probably the most widely used by top-level players and chess journalists. This large installed base of customers is a definite plus. Specific complaints about Chessbase 12 - Documentation errors. The Help files (and downloadable manual) often refer to features from older verions of Chessbase which have since been updated. Worse I think some of the help is for another product (like Fritz--also made by Chessbase). - Notation Pane often goes blank. You have to click on the Notation Pane scroll-bar to restore the notation. - More board customization. I prefer lower-case board coordinates. Chessbase only has upper-case and it makes the coordinates too distracting. Also there is no option to place coordinates on all 4 sides of the board (The print option allows this). - No explanation of certain features. The engine pane is the worst example. There is an indicatior light that usually is grey but sometimes goes red, green or yellow. The help says this is \"Fail High/Low\". That\\'s it. I finally found what it means by searching the internet and finding an article on the engine. In summary I really like Chessbase 12 but I think it would nice if the developers would improve some existing functions rather than add features that are nice but have limited value for most players like Cloud Analysis and Let\\'s Check. Of course many people want these leading edge features and will pay to upgrade.',\n",

       " \"I've owned all versions of chessbase starting from cb7. There were a lot of little bugs in CB11, and this version (CB12) fixes most of those. A few that are fixed now: - When Chessbase is restarted and a function to display a window is taken, the window will be the same size and in the same location it was last opened at. Before (CB11), multiple monitor systems with different resolution monitors would always put the windows partly off the top of the screen with an extra long vertical dimension, and they always required adjustment in order to be useful. - The x for canceling cb windows no longer disappears when the computer goes to sleep and is reawakened. Before, the x would no longer show after the computer was restarted from sleep mode. To cancel required right clicking on the icon in the task bar and then selecting close window. Edit: 1/22/13 this bug still exists on cb12. - The ribbon menus are more consistent when the option to default to a minimize ribbon is used. Right click on a blank area of a ribbon menu, and select `minimize ribbon' to use that feature. When you want access to a menu, click on the section you want (e.g. Home) and the ribbon menu is displayed as a drop down. Too me, the most noticeable feature added is the 'Let's check' database when running computer analysis. While running analysis, the top moves selected by various commercial chess engines are also displayed with the number of plies searched by each engine and the position evaluation. This database is updated primarily by Chessbase and Fritz user's own computers. When a user's engine calculates deeper into the position (more plies), it's evaluation updates CB's let's check database. Subsequent users (from anywhere in the world!) will see that evaluation next time they arrive at the same position. Updating of Let's Check database can be turned off, but is on by default. One of the nicest features of Chessbase, that competing products seem to lack, is the ability to open chess boards, databases, opening books, etc. outside of the main environment window. This feature has been available since CB8. The reason this is so useful, is because it's very common to have many chessboards and databases open at the same time. Trying to fit them in a single environment window is often problematic. With Chessbase, they can be placed and sized anywhere on the desktop. Even within a chessboard window, the engine evaluations, opening book, and move list can be moved outside of the chessboard, or automatically made to fit in the window that's dedicated to that chessboard. For someone that researches openings, tournaments, players, and/or historical games, I don't think there is a better product. Alternatives I'm aware of are Convetka's Chess Assistant, and several freeware products (SCID and Chessdb are ones I've looked at before).\",\n",
       " \"This was exactly what my daughter needed. Her Chessbase 9 program was no longer quite meeting her needs so she was thrilled to get this updated version.

       " \"If you like the fritz family of chessbase software this will be the same old same old with some new features. The feature that tells you the level of play that is ongoing in a game is a fun feature. For example when I'm making solid moves my elo will be in the 1800s or 1900s and when I play a crummy move or series of moves it can go down to 1500 elo. Kind of interesting to look at as you play the fritz engine. Kind of buggy in places but chessbase always updates and corrects any errors. Good on three machines which is vastly improved. Fritz engine seems like the same as always but I usually will download the latest stockfish engine for free and use that anyway. Overall very similar to previous versions but an excellent program in and of itself. Would recommend unless you have 15 or so.\",\n",
       " \"I was skeptical about the new GUI. The old interface is still there nonetheless. I really enjoyed the easy mode. Clicking on the pieces gives you a quick assessment visually on the board. It is great to see potential combinations and focus though on the intended plan. There are other new features too, just look up Chessbase's YouTube videos about the new Fritz 16 interface. I am pleasantly surprised and this replaces Fritz 15 GUI for me. Yes, other engines are stronger and you can get Stockfish 8 and use it under Fritz as a UCI engine. I find this to be Chessbase's best GUI overhaul I can think of (going back to Fritz 7). I am also using this on an iMac running WIndows 10 with VMWare Fusion and there are no issues.\",\n",

The \"classic\" interface gives hints when you pick up the piece (I searched the manual and all the settings to turn this off, to no avail - I also sent an email and no answer). After 2 weeks, I am giving up on it and going back to the Fritz 14 interface. To add insult to injury, Houdini 4 beat Fritz 16 in a engine match 6 to 1. This was on 5 min games using 2 CPUs. However, I was pleased to see that when I increased the time to 15 minutes and processing to 4 CPUs, Fritz 16 was undefeated (5 and 0) - Houdini 4 only allowed 3 CPUs)',\n",

Separate software is required to manage them - No help file, it just wanders off into a redundant web-browser with a pathetic Google-like translation of German into some sort of pidgin English - Confusing implementation of the Ribbon with a mix of styles and formats; regularly have to hunt the right option - Opens irrelevant games when launching program The new bright yellow initial screen is a mostly useless gimmick, and not helped by the buttons to close the program being hidden off screen.',\n",

Kasparov's take on chess history is fascinating, but his method of presentation is better for strong players than weaker players. This is definitely NOT the DVD to buy a child who is just learning the game. To pull a number out of my head, I'd say you should only buy this if you're rated 1800 USCF or higher, and here's why. I learn the most, and I think most people learn the most, from methodical discussion of important games, then trying to apply that into my own games, then trying to figure out where I went wrong. Kasparov only spends about 4 minutes per game (!!??!!). He's assuming the viewer already knows how to execute plans in the middle game that arise from the opening. I got this DVD on sale, so it was definitely worth the money, and it includes an annotated game collection, so I'm sure I'll be referring back to it for years. But I had to purchase a different Queen's Gambit DVD, just so I would have the background necessary to understand this one.\",\n",
       " \"This is truly a rare treat. Garry Kasparov, quite likely the best openings expert in the history of chess, and World Champion for about 15 years, has here given a very valuable overview of one of the most fundamentally important openings in chess, the Queens' Gambit Declined. The DVD is in the form of a games collection, with all of the major variations covered. Kasparov's presentation is fascinating. He gives a blend of historical background and fundamental instruction. His accent is rather strong, but he is quite eloquent, charismatic and in general easy to understand. You will not get every theoretical variation that you would need to play the Queen's Gambit at a high level with such a general overview, of course, but this DVD is so compelling and well done that any chess player from casual club player up to master (and probably beyond) will benefit from the presentation. Don't miss the chance to get instruction from the player that many consider the strongest player of all time. Even if you don't play the Queen's Gambit you will profit from Kasparov's explanations, and you will enjoy yourself as you learn! Very highly recommended.\",\n",

If you want to fly spacecraft, a better choice would be Orbiter or Microsoft Space Simulator. But if you're interested in running a space program and watching your ships go to the Moon, this game is fantastic. It's strongly historically based (though tweaked for game balance) and you're not limited to Apollo capsules. You can also fly Gemini capsules to the Moon, or reusable minishuttles, or even a direct ascent spacecraft like in the old sci-fi novels. The original floppy version of this game runs well in DOSBox.

After receiving the microphone in question, I plugged it into my USB port, only to find that it didn\\'t work. \"Odd,\" I thought and tried a different USB port. This one worked, and I began playing. Now, to give a bit of backstory. I have two televisions in my room: an HDTV and a normal \"box\" television. After getting fed up with attempting to calibrate the system correctly, I now move back and forth between the two televisions whenever I wish to play a musical rhythm game. Obviously, for vocals, an HDTV can be used uncalibrated, as, if you know the song, you do not need to watch the notes go by, so I had had the Xbox plugged into this. Later, when I decided to switch TVs to play my guitar, I eventually replugged in the microphone in the same USB port that I had plugged it in previously. It didn\\'t work. Now frustrated, I retried every port, only to finally find one that worked, which happened to be the very first port I\\'d tried previously. I later came to find that the microphone I received had a short in the wire, almost as if it were used (which is entirely possible, as I got no packaging, only a plastic wrapper around the microphone). As for the performance itself when I actually get the thing to work, it works nicely. It picks up on my voice fairly well, although you have to keep it at a very precise angle, or it may lose lower volumes. There is enough cord length that I can sing at my preferred distance (although I sit very close to my televisions, so take this statement with a grain of salt). It\\'s not a bad mic, and I\\'m sure the short was just a defect on the part of my microphone. Not bad, overall.',\n",

       " 'The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural is written \"in-character\" and presented as a faux artifact from the era of the Old Republic. It contains detachable items, intended to enhance the feeling that you have something really of the Star Wars universe. This adds much to the enjoyment and presentation of the book. The journal was written both as a stand-alone book, and to be part of the Collectors Edition of Star Wars: The Old Republic. I bought the Collectors Edition before the game launched, in preparing my gaming guild (Sons of Numenor/Scions of Korriban) to play it. Of all the real and in-game items included as part of the Collectors Edition, this was the most rewarding. It complements the content presented online at the games website, and fits well among other books related to Star Wars lore. If there is anything disappointing, it is that the book is not longer. As the stories and narratives are fascinating, and do much to add depth and flavor to characters and story beyond it. This book is worth having as a Star Wars collector, on just one seeking to add a bit more depth to their knowledge of its lore. If ones plays Star Wars: The Old Republic, it is very much worth having. These will become more rare by the month. Complete copies, with all of the included detached items, will become even more rare. I would also strongly recommend two specific books in addition to this. They are \"The Jedi Path,\" and \"The Book of Sith.\" (either the stand-alone edition, or the excellent \"Vault\" editions.) Each of those two books, are written and presented in the same artifact style as this journal. They are among the most collectable Star Wars books, and fit perfectly alongside The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural. Do look them up and be aware of them, if you find this book interesting. At the timing of writing this, you can buy this book alone, for prices ranging about $17. The full Collectors Edition of Star Wars: The Old Republic has dipped as low as $29 at in-store locations, and averages in the $80 range on Amazon. The full Collectors Edition does come with other items of worth to collectors, but having this book is worth buying it alone if need-be.',\n",

I did check and have the problem across more than one tv, so it's not the tv's fault. I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii, but I doubt so, as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with (why, Wii, did you not include component/hdmi cabling by default? HD isn't that rare). Ah, but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable I could find, and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cabling.\",\n",

Update May 7, 2013 After using the cables for a while I occasionally get a green tinted screen when I load my Wii, although I've been able to get it to go away restartig the Wii and replugging in the cords. Also after using my Wii to watch Netflix more I can say that the color hasn't bee great and is not very accurate to when the show is watched on my laptop or through original broadcast. I also can't really say that its the cords or the Wii that is going bad and making the color go bad. At some point I'm going to try to borrow cords for a friend and test it out. Ultimately though the cords were dirt cheap compared to other I looked at and I would not be surprised or even mad if they went bad after being used for a while.\",\n",

       " \"I agree with most other reviewers on this cable in that it helps with the Netflix viewing, but not so much with the gaming. I think this is because of the way the games are made (I could totally be wrong on this). Certain games like Donkey Kong Country Returns look better with this cable, but Black Ops looks the same. There is a noticeable difference in my Netflix streaming though. So, for six bucks this is what I got, and I'm happy with it, but not over the moon.\",\n",
       " \"After few months of use cable flicker and video goes off as i watch my netflix online using component cable. Picture quality is very accurate on my LCD. I don't know if flickering is due to cable or my nitendo but some online site suggested it could be cable.\",\n",
       " 'First, this is a low cost cable, and so is built. The RCA ports are easy to get loose and slip out of the tv connector. Also is not well shielded , you will have to route the cable away from RF interference or power lines, or you\\'ll notice flickering video. Overall in a simple connection it should work fine, but in a entertainment system where are some other devices, as home theater, networking equipment, etc, the cable will pick a LOT of Noise. Also it should be a permanent installation, since it is not sturdy enough to resist multiple pulling in / out of the connectors. Otherwise it will do the trick, and having your WII in 480P will not make it a HD console, that the wii is not capable of, but picture will be clearer, sharper (I don\\'t know, but in my 40\" LCD image out of the standard cable seems a bit blurry)and with more defined colors',\n",

So it's an ok cable that doesn't make much difference, but I would still recommend it, so that you can use a component input on your tv, instead of composite.\",\n",
       " \"...that Nintendo (or Sony, Monster Cable, etc.) can ask so much for things that don't cost nearly so much to manufacture; the name brand cables are probably made in China right alongside these third-party counterparts. $30 was out of the question for me right now, so I figured I'd take a chance on this. 5 or 6 bucks, WITH shipping. It does come in a clear plastic bag with no labeling or instructions, but it's a high-quality cable that performs perfectly. No problems whatsoever (grant it, I've only had it a day, but I don't forsee anything changing as sturdy as it is). The colors are noticably brighter, and to my surprise, everything does appear crisper! As mentioned, just remember to go to Wii Settings and change TV resolution to 480p.\",\n",

The cable preforms fine except that when ever anything kicks on, ie dishwasher, refrigerator, furnace, in our house I get flicker on the television set. Now it isn't enough to return the product as I bought cheap and received cheap. I may go back to the cables that came with the system and live with 480i. Just beware that when buying cheap you have to remember that you get what you pay for.\",\n",

       " 'I agree with other reviews that the video for gaming is not improved in \"HD\" using a component video cable with your Wii console. I looked at the bowling game before and after switching, and it looked the same. I got the disc from Netflix for watching movies on the Wii. I compared by starting a movie with the original video cable. The video was fuzzy and just blah on my HD TV. Paused the movie and switched cables. Restarted the movie and it looked the same. Then I realized that I have to go to the Wii set up menu to change from 480i to 480p. After that the picture was much better. Netflix \"Instant\" streaming movies now look as good as playing the DVD. The image is sized to fill my wide screen HD TV. The cable itself has full sized plugs for video and audio. On my TV the jack spacing leaves no gap between plugs, making plugging it in tight. Make sure every plug is fully inserted if you have picture or sound issues.',\n",
       " 'cable arrived in timely manner. Hooked it up to TV but did not work properly. Wii picture was close to black and white only. Appears that the leads were mislabeled or misaligned as sound only came on when the green video connection was plugged in. Would suggest buying different cable. Not sure if will return, cable very cheap relative to cost of shipping return',\n",
       " \"The image quality seems to be leagues better than it was before. When I first hooked up my Wii we (my girlfriend and I) had a 27 inch Sanyo tube television. The picture looked great because of the aspect ratio; video game systems were built around televisions like this. We soon decided we wanted a bigger and better image and upgraded to a 37' Vizio LCD. We were saddened to see picture quality decrease exponentially and quickly became confused as to why our Wii didn't look great on what we knew to be a much better television. We found these cables online and after applying them noticed the picture was 100% better in quality. Long story short: Researched component cables, found them on Amazon for a great price. Ordered cables, arrived very quickly and they worked as described.\",\n",

Graphics: The graphics are amazing very fine and sharp which doesn't happen with most games. Sound: The sound if wonderful although it sometimes is a little slow, but other then that it's really good. Pros: Help ppl learn about different plants, fish and wild game. Is really fun to play and it never gets old. Has really cool short movies that you can watch over and over again. Cons: For some reason the rattle snakes always try to kill me. Can sometimes be a little tricky but if you bye the right stuff you will be fine. The disc got scratched up pretty easyly from just being in the Cd rom.

Porsche wasn't a sim, but it struck a perfect balance between a sim and arcade. Motor City Online was also an excellent game that was slightly ahead of it's time. Everyone didn't have access to high speed internet yet so they allowed dial-up user to play which caused allot of lag and probably was the main reason the game didn't take off like it should have. I'm not the best driver but MCO offer several other avenues of game play. I'm an old school mechanic so I love building and modify cars, even setup up a dedicated website where I built and sold custom virtual engines. Even had numerous offers from people wanting to buy my custom engines thinking they were real. The auction was also a great feature, I'd get up at3 amjust to get a better deal on a part or car. Ea should re-release these games in a classic bundle. I'm sure they would sell. Be great if they updated them a bit to take advantage of modern hardware. Even if they don't want to re-code the entire games, just patch it to run on modern OSes like Win 8 and up (Linux too)Not sure if EA owned Grand Prix Ledgends but it was other excellent game, but it leaned pretty heavy towards a sim. Nascar Racing 2001 by Papyrus stayed in High demand for years, EA bought it, changed the physics and ruined it. Need to re-do it and put the physics back to what everyone liked.

       " 'These are the second and third installments in the Nancy Drew PC line and while they might not be as graphically stimulating as the newer games and little bit on the short (not too short) side, the originals have something the newer games sometimes lack; an in-depth intriguing mystery that actually takes place like an actual crime/mystery that you would need to put a lot of thought and logic into to actually solve; just like on CSI. The second and third installments: Stay Tuned for Danger and Message in a Haunted Mansion are a step up-- graphics-wise -- from the original Secrets Can Kill PC game, but pale in comparison to the newer games. However that\\'s to be expected the late 90\\'s versus the beginning of the second decade of the twenty first century. There have been some complaints as to the older version games not being able to play on newer OS, that would be incorrect. We have OS\\'s Windows: XP, Vista and 7; we have Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill (original), Stay Tuned for Danger, Message in a Haunted Mansion plus almost the rest of the Nancy Drew PC line running on these OS\\'s. If you computer\\'s OS isn\\'t smart enough to switch over to the formats for you you can try the following instructions below; otherwise the game will install, but will not play because it was intended to run a much larger file in a much smaller window (I know that doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense, but it is correct in the way I explained it). This is what you need to do if you have a newer computer/OS (Windows: XP, Vista, 7, 8) and you are trying to play this older model game: You need to first install the game. It will do a computer anaylisis and will tell you that your computer \"Fails\" under two categories 1.) Color Resolution and 2.) OS (Operating System), ignore and install the game anyway. If you click to play the game after the install and an \"Error\" message appears close it and manually change your computer\\'s compatibility mode. To set your computer to run in Compatibility Mode: This can be accessed from the Control Panel; just type in \"Older Version\" in the Control Panel Search Bar and the link will show up. Click it. A Dialog box will pop up and ask which version of Windows you would like to run this program in, choose either Windows: 95, 98 or ME. The computer should ask you if you wish to save this profile for every time you use this particular program click \"Yes\" or \"Apply\". Also from the Control Panel or by Right Clicking on your Desktop under \"Screen Resolution\" switch your pixel resolution all the way down to 800x600. If for some reason you computer does not switch back to normal once you\\'ve ejected the game, then once again, just reset the changes manually. The same goes for the fact, if your computer does not automatically set itself back to an older version of windows and a smaller screen resolution when you play the game again; just do it manually, it literally takes two minutes, both ways. Regardless of how much the graphics may suck, any older model game can play on a newer computer/OS whether it\\'s on a CD-ROM or a Floppy Diskette (as long as you have a USB enabled External Floppy Diskette Drive or you hard wire one into your Desktop).',\n",

The uber-boss, Shinnok, is actually a playable character and is far too easy to beat while the sub-boss, Goro, is next to impossible to defeat except with 1 or 2 specific fighters. Overall, I think this was one of the best MK games simply because it carries in the tradition of the glory days(MK 3).

You can also burn them to a CD and show them to your friends. While this does sound awesome, the execution is not done all that well. The first thing you will notice is how dated the graphics are, even for 2006. Deus Ex (released in 2000) looks much better than this does. The animations are sloppy and the environments look bland. For the audio, the sounds effects are very stock and unimpressive. The music for the game is also pretty generic. However, you can put your own music into the game that you create if you change the format of the audio file. The game-play is decent enough. Being able to create your games from scratch is enjoyable. There is a good amount of customization you have when creating your games from the objectives of the level to the rewards for beating it. As you complete certain tasks, you unlock new features which give you much more customization to the various features of the levels. However, the mechanics are very limited. After testing out your games, you realize that the games feel very clunky. The controls are some of the worst in video games and there is absolutely no way to change the key bindings. Also, there is nothing really \"tycoon\" about it. You\\'re not making games to sell them and there isn\\'t any business aspect to it. It\\'s very strange considering the word \"tycoon\" is in the title. Overall, I feel disappointed with this game. The concept is cool enough, but the execution was not up to par.

The Corporatist perspective is to treat you like trash, i.e. calling you names like \"idiot! moron!, etc.\" vs. actually teaching you what you need to know in order to proceed to the next level.

But, if you\\'ve dabbled in Empire Earth, AOE, Age of Mythology, and enjoy these economy based warfare games, definitely give ANNO 2070 a shot. There is a learning curve, particularly if you are a newcomer to the series. Essentially, this game is about meeting the needs (food, drink, belongings, entertainment, community, etc.) of your citizens, which become increasingly demanding as they rise from the ranks of common workman to something equivalent of CEO. With their progression brings higher taxes income, yielding a stronger economy capable of building and supporting an impressive military. Warfare is not necessarily the focus, or even the majority of the fun, in this game, but it still gives the option for ship, submarine, and aerial combat, with several units of each type available. You can even go nuclear. It\\'s pretty sweet. There are three \"races\" of people. It\\'s a bit like Starcraft in that they can each build their own units, and have their own specific needs. The first group is the ECOS - they are the liberal hippy tree huggers who care only about thee environment, and turn unhappy if the ecobalance becomes too polluted. The 2nd group, the TYCOONS, are the seal clubbin\\' oil drillin\\' conservatives who care only about making money no matter the cost. Finally, you have the TECHS, a faction only concerned with technological research. The TECHS are featured moreso in the expansion (ANNO 2070: Deep Ocean), but are still important for development of ECO and TYCOON needs as they advance. I highly recommend the expansion if you play this and find you like it - it adds so many new ways to develop your cities. I love this game. I\\'ve always been a fan of city builders, but this one (like ANNO 1404) has really drawn me in. I\\'ve put in weeks worth of hours on it and am still playing. The campaign missions are fun, but the real joy lies in a continuous game. Once you are comfortable playing, you can spend literally hours on a hard continuous game with 3 AI players, a pirate base, and a warship hellbent on your destruction. It is still a challenge even after playing for over a year. I think a lot of what makes it fun is that no two games are ever played the same way. There are different ways to power your city, different upgrades to utilize, different ways to destroy your opponents. A quick note about DRM: It sucks that this game must be played with a constant internet connection. There is a multi-player faction, but honestly I\\'ve never even tried it. Single player is what I enjoy, and there\\'s no reason to be online for that. Still, I give it five stars, because the game itself warrants it IMO.',\n",

This entailed screen caps of receipts, manual covers and proof of a real CD (they were very helpful). Ok, Now I can play... NOT! Every time it loaded, it Crashed To Desktop (CTD). Ok, so now I have spent another day looking up info on the web about that. I had to lower my computer resolution to 800x600 AND change some of the graphics settings to low AND had to turn off stuff in the uPlay settings. Ok, finally got a profile setup (and you only get 1). Now, I get to play... NOT! Every time I accept a side mission it CTD's and I have to kill the proses just to exit the game. I can put up with a lot of stuff if the game runs, but I cannot deal with having to save before every quest, mouse over on the info tabs, etc just in case my game crashes. Hell, I cannot even play single missions without it crashing. I was hoping the expansion would help stabilize it, but I have decided to send them both back. I was willing to put up with uPlay, even if the DRM sucks. What do you mean I can't change my hardware? Ok, I have a laptop and thought that would be ok. Till I found out that 3 is the limit.

You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don\\'t confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn\\'t seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There\\'s no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn\\'t hard to do hand to hand. It wasn\\'t 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn\\'t bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don\\'t read if you can\\'t take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn\\'t believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals. Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can\\'t even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it\\'s a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower. Don\\'t waste your $ on the Pro Edition.',\n",

Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options. Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you. Love this feature! Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity. I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.

This game makes Codemasters the king of graphics realism. BUY THIS GAME !!!!! December 6, 2011 I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you. First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3. Thank God for codemasters and I can hardly wait for GRID 2 in the summer.',\n",

That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security. CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play. Annoying interface. Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do. Most settings don\\'t keep between sessions. Setting up a race takes way too long. Irritating \"music\" you can\\'t turn off (it keeps coming back). Takes too long to unlock things. Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.

This game was not worth the time, and I\\'ve yet to be able to actually play a full race. It took two evenings from when I got home from work until after midnight just to get this game installed. I wanted to try playing video games, so I bought a computer and some games. The installation takes hours, crashed my computer multiple times, required many dependencies (like \"MS games for windows live\") that must be installed separately. The only way to find out you need this other software is to search the forums... If you don\\'t have some dependency, after an hour of waiting the install finishes but the game doesn\\'t start. I even had to edit XML configuration files to get the program to start at all. The game can\\'t be played unless I am *both* logged into xbox live *and* have the DVD in the drive. I find that DVD\\'s scratch easily, I consider them transfer media not a reliable way to store data. Since they already have the DRM of a mandatory windows-live service, I don\\'t see why they would cripple the game even further with the disk requirement. For this reason, if you ignore my advice, at least get the downloadable version. I\\'ll probably copy the dvd image to disk as an iso with CloneDrive, but it\\'s an extra 7gb of data that has already been installed on my hard disk for a game that... can\\'t be played anyway. Once I finally ironed out the installation issues, and was actually able to get the game started, 2 minutes into each attempt at a car race the entire computer would crash. Black screen, unresponsive, numlock doesn\\'t even change the lights on my keyboard, needing a hard-reboot. I know some will assume I just don\\'t know how to install software, or that I have an old computer, or that I have viruses. I\\'m a software engineer with over a decade of software development experience. All of the other games I bought on Amazon or Steam worked fine (including one other that also required the windows live service). My computer is two weeks old and fast, i5, 8gb of ram, a discrete graphics card, nearly brand new. Even if this was a resource issue, the game shouldn\\'t consistently crash my entire computer to the point of needing a hard reboot. The price for the game isn\\'t high, but don\\'t waste your *time* on the PC version of this game. If you\\'re a young kid and you\\'ve got all of your summer vacation to play around with figuring out installation issues, maybe this will be a good learning experience for you.

       " \"I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games. I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt. Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak. You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1. The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it. Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude. The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time. Once you get past this, it does get better. At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down. I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting. I use a gamepad to play on the PC. I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA). The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow. The cars are not quite as varied as I would like. I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live. Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live. Many of the cars are available to purchase too. That is cheesy and not appreciated. You don't need to purchase these to advance though. The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3. I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2. Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth. Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.\",\n",

It is more fun to me, to race against people I know than computer controlled cars. Especially as the computer controlled cars don't always seem to realize that you're right beside them, and will hit you, causing you to spin out, wreck, or generally have problems. One of the more annoying things about this game is that you have to sign up for Microsoft Live, or something like that. You get a predetermined name, which is generally nonsense. And every time you want to play this game, you have to sign into Live. The other complaint I have is that if you want more cars, you don't earn them by being good at the game. You buy them.

       " 'As an avid SCCA rallyx driver, I was hoping to get something that was even a little bit like actually rally driving, but was severely disappointed. There is absolutely no relationship to driving this \"car\" to anything in real life, other than when you step on the gas it goes forward. In actual rally driving you use throttle steering to actually steer the car; its the defining quality of racing on dirt. To do that you need to be able to keep the steering wheel straight, and use the brake to shift weight forward and back to control car rotation. But in the game the car is impossible to steer straight going 5mpg on a straight road, let alone hit racing speeds. I tried every single possible controller setting, and even bought a brand-new wheel. Both had the same problem: turning the wheel 5 degrees results in the steering inputs reacting as if I turned the wheel 10, or 15, or 20, or 30 degrees depending on the speed. The only workaround I could find was the \"dead zone\", making the wheel inoperable while centered, and then it violently overracts when turned outside of the dead zone. Using that I could steer straight and then sharply turn, then go straight, then sharply turn. Ridiculous, yes, but if you watch videos of people driving on youtube.com that\\'s how the game was apparently designed. You\\'d think that a driver-oriented game would have a multitude of options for the most important aspect of driving: controlling the car. Instead, the game is horribly slowed down by useless eye-candy graphics and a ridiculously obtuse interface. Just starting the game and getting to the point of driving a car takes 10 minutes while you frantically hit the enter key trying to tell it to skip the fancy graphics and storyline and get on with the darn game. If its racing you want then iracing.com is still the only realistic option. This is worse than even Mario Kart!',\n",
       " \"I bought this game earlier this year and was working ok, but when I filled out the xbox live profile this game runs on. It already had a profile name.

It was my first time using xbox live and existing account name had some racing type ring to it, I figured it was part of the game set up for you to personalize screen name if you wanted to change it. Either way the game stopped working, wouldnt load anymore, and a window telling me that game copy was not origanal. So to me, with the other reviews saying game will not load. Im wondering if people are paying attention to windows saying why it will not load. Im guessing the seller or somebody who works there is taking the games number pass code and making copies. With the low price of the game whos gonna go through the hassel and demand a refund after 3 or 4 months of having this game. I never bothered to bring this up to the seller, because in the end with the games low price I can see the seller accuse me of the copying. Try and google the seller and its reviews (its been some time since I did this. Dont know if they still have origanal name). I did and they were not good.

       " 'Pros: The game is about driving all sorts of vehicles on all different terrain, and at that the game does very well. There are a number of different vehicles to unlock in each vehicle category and the tracks range from asphalt to dirt to snow, some mixing the various terrains in a single course. If anybody has played any of the Colin McRae Rally games, or naturally any of the previous Dirt games, they should feel right at home* (see Cons for *). The game basically has the player build up his fame to gain more sponsorships and be invited to tournaments and open new seasons. In the first season you are shown all terrains types and give the opportunity to learn gymkhana (~stunt driving~). The graphics are polished and high quality, especially on the vehicles, and engine audio is up to par. Gameplay is fairly straightforward, yet quite entertaining. Smashing your and opponent\\'s vehicles is a ton of fun and damage modeling is well done. Its just fun to drive and crash in the game. The game is very \"modular\" and can be picked up to play for just a short while or you can go all out and spend hours and hours. Cons: Gameplay can get repetitive, and even if the type of event is switched nearly every other race, you get to replay the same tracks, a number of times in different events (which are \"different\" really only by name). Car feel is somewhat bland, most cars in the same group feel very similar or nearly identical, the biggest difference you will feel is the stopping distance increase with more horsepower of the car. By contrast, this also makes it weird when a car actually behaves quite differently than the others, such as Ken Block\\'s car or the Original Mini Cooper. In conjunction to the above, car handling is a bit weird at times, might be me, using a keyboard, but, during a normal dirt rally stage, you pretty much cannot recover from a real handbrake turn. Not sure if it is because of car tuning or abs still on (abs should not matter, but it\\'s the only thing I have on) but once the car\\'s back-end has slid around past say 20 degrees off center, the slide is irrecoverable. Does not matter if you apply full opposite lock, does not matter if you break, accelerate, or just let go of the gas pedal, does not matter what type of turn it is (shy of a hairpin), your call will keep sliding in the same direction, potentially getting more sideways, until you crash or slow down to 10 km/h (6mp/h). Games for Windows Live - whenever you see this logo, be afraid, very afraid! In Dirt 3, you will HAVE TO have or create a Windows Live account, or you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE THE GAME. Or play online for that matter. This is just some crappy DRM scheme and I was quite sad to find out about it, as this, plus having to always have the dvd in your drive, makes just booting the game an annoyance. Once all is set up, its not that bad of a hassle, but still, why punish players that buy the game? The menus and animations, and introductions will drive you up a wall. The are cool the first 100 times, -_- , not allowing me a way to skip them is just cruel. You will notice this the most when you enter a race: unskippable animation to show you your car, 1 second pause, menu pops up with \"Race\" and \"Mod car stuff\", etc, and then another 5 second animation to show you your car again, but on the starting grid, 1 second pause, and then its time to race, 3 second countdown till you can actually drive. Also every time you select an item from the race menu (those triangle things) again, animation, 1 second halt, here is what you ordered, oh new selection, sorry that need another animation. * People that were used to the Colin McRae games might be wondering where real rally went in the game. The one with the stages, and having to spend time in between races to repair damage, having to complete a few stages of a race with a half broken car. The special feeling of being part of the WRC is mostly gone. Now most races are on the short side (they do get longer as you progress), can be restarted at any point and no previous-race progress is lost, and even more there is the rewind feature. Naturally you do not need to use these mechanics, but just being there spoils the mood. Other Thoughts: It may seem like I slammed the game pretty hard, but then gave it a strangely high mark. The point is that the game is good, quite good, despite all the above issues, which all in all are actually fairly small things. Plus the cheap price bumps it up a notch. You will want to immediately turn off all assists (keep the driving line and abs at first, then decide for yourself) else the car basically drives itself. The loss of a true rally mode may be a make it or break it deal for somebody. The game is really fun, the driving is very fun regardless of the issues stated above, yet you will miss good ol\\' Colin. I would have given the game 3.5 out of 5, just because of the great stuff lost over the years, but I realized that it was not fair to compare it with something that (unfortunately) it is not anymore. For $12 it\\'s a great deal.',\n",
       " 'I greatly enjoyed Dirt 2 and picked up Dirt 3 for more dirt racing action (truck racing is my favorite). I actually found this rather duller than Dirt 2, less \"game-like,\" the locations a bit monotonous, and way too much emphasis on gymkhana, when what I really want is land rush, rally, rally cross. Requiring gymkhana to advance past the first level is annoying, to say the least, and may be a deal breaker for some people. However, it is possible to modify the database file to completely unlock the game. In fact, you can modify the database to unlock all the cars, all the races. Just google \"dirt 3 unlock mod.\" The file is a replacement for \"database.bin\" - so all you have to do is search for that file, save the original file as backup and replace it with the unlocked database. (And, after you play through to the next level, you can put the original file back.) It\\'s a fairly easy fix even for the so-so computer literate. The upshot though is, Codemasters could have included an option to bypass gymkhana for those just wanting rally and not screech-braking in a parking lot.

I had to eliminate the force feedback and tweak it quite a bit to have it to a point where the delay would have a minimal interference with gameplay. The competitions in the game are lame and it is not a game that invites you to play. The career mode is lame in that they make you do all sorts of challenges like spinning your car and making it skid, and then different styles of racing (rally, tarmak, race with others on dirt) with lame cars. If you like one particular style of racing, you are really forced to do all styles so it gets old. I must say, the driving engine is good, but the game is just boring and doesnt entice me to keep playing.

For those who don't know, gymkhana is an event where you drift through corridors, do donuts, jump ramps, and so on. I don't practice it because I don't like it, so those events tend to be frustrating. Otherwise it's a great game, I just wish they had done a gymkhana only track that could be avoided.\",\n",

       " \"In today's game market it's easy to miss racing games that aren't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises. Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks. -If you want to win, employ a Fin!\",\n",

My DVD drive, which has NEVER had an issue with anything before takes about 2 minutes to register the DVD. Clearly whatever factory they used to burn this disc along with the DRM rubbish did a real fine job. You must have DVD in drive to play game, so need to wait 2 minutes before can play - assuming it reads disk, which it only does 1/3 of the time ;-/ #2.

I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off. As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating. Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss. Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!

If your install does not work and the game gives you and error, you may be on your own. Codemaster\\'s tech support? Responded twice total. I spent another $30 on a registry and .dll fixer, nothing, then they told me to uninstall a bunch of other stuff I had on my machine and then when I did, wouldn\\'t return my response that their help did not resolve my problem. Poof, gone. There is no phone number and their home page is on Facebook. So I used Google and found their official forum and posted a lengthy message with the details as requested by their forum guide and got NOTHING, no help.

       " 'I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it. I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap. It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case. I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu\\'s , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it.

(You have to have Win98 AT LEAST to get this trick to work. \\'95 and 3.1 are both no-goes. I\\'d assume any other Windows version that supports 16bit apps will work for you.) Next, make sure you\\'ve installed Virtual Machine Additions, and enable hard drive sharing. That allows you to access the physical hard drives on your that you tell Virtual PC to share in the settings. Next, put your YDKJ CD or ISO image in, capture the drive, (this trick works with any Jack game save for 5th Dementia...you\\'ll just have to install and play that one on the virtual machine), install the game, then copy the entire contents of the Jack CD (save for the setup files), overwrite anything and everything, then try running the game without the CD. If it runs, then copy the game\\'s folder on to your computer\\'s physical hard drive. Then in your newer Windows system, make sure that you apply the 640x480 resolution compatitbilty setting to the game. That prevents the game from being a tiny window in the middle of the screen.

Instead of the kind, warm, and friendly voice of an Alex Trebek or Regis Philbin, the host of \"You Don\\'t Know Jack\" is more reminiscent of Anne Robinson from THE WEAKEST LINK with his sarcastic comments and snide asides. It makes for a fun, entertaining, and educational experience. This is the YOU DON\\'T KNOW JACK MOVIES and the questions all have something to do about film. Don\\'t be fooled by the playfulness and multiple-choice options, some of these questions are extremely difficult to get, even if your mind is a walking encyclopedia of film knowledge. The game can be played in two different formats: a seven question round and a twenty-one question round. The seven question format takes about fifteen minutes to play while the longer version takes almost forty-five. Most of the questions are in multiple choice, but there are different types: picture questions, fill in the blanks, whatshisname questions, gibberish questions, dis or dat choices, and the final round of the game is called Jack Attack (an association question). I\\'ve found the gibberish questions the most difficult because it takes me a little longer to remember movies that sound like what appears on the screen. Also, if you play the game with more than one person there is a \"screw your neighbor round\" where you can force someone else to answer a question instead of yourself.

       " 'First things first: this is the greatest game I have ever played. Second: yes, this is the old DOS version that on its own probably won\\'t work on your computer. However, there is a ***free*** program called Exult that will allow you to play Ultima 7 on new versions of Windows, including Vista and Windows 7. But you *must* have Ultima 7 installed for it to work, because it has to access the game files, so you do have to own this game already to play. That being said... This game changed my mind about Ultima and about what games could accomplish in storytelling and scope. Going back about 15 years, I\\'d seen my friend play Ultima 4 and Ultima 6 at his house before and thought they looked okay, but it wasn\\'t until I played Ultima 7 that I really \"got\" it. Ultima 7--the Complete Ultima 7--is simply epic in every sense. You start out transporting into the town of Trinsic in Britannia, where your old pal Iolo is waiting and informs you that a ritualistic double murder has occurred in town, and your first task by order of the mayor of Trinsic is to investigate the crime scene, interview the townsfolk, and report back to him with your findings. So begins one of the most epic video games you will ever play. From there you will begin interviewing townsfolk, learn about recent events and attacks on the town, and begin learning about a religious organization called The Fellowship that seems to have taken Britannia by storm with its influence. The organization appears to have good intentions, but appearances can be deceiving, and it isn\\'t long before you are tasked by Lord British with joining The Fellowship so you can further investigate what goes on behind the scenes with The Fellowship and its charismatic, enigmatic, and inexplicably sinister leader, Batlin. And maybe figure out what the deal is with that big red face, otherwise known as The Guardian, who occasionally pops up on your screen and taunts you while you\\'re playing. And as you suspect, not all is what it seems with The Fellowship, and it is up to you to rescue Britannia from the threats within. Along the way you will spend innumerable hours taking in the ENORMOUS, living, breathing world of Britannia that Origin created. You will meet many companions for your party, some new and some old, and forge relationships with them through the clever, witty, and well-written dialog. You will meet the huge populace of the world, detailed to the extent that they all have their own houses, their own jobs, their own lives, and if you stand around and watch, you can see them engaging in all three over the course of each day. No, you won\\'t just see people in their shops 24/7 while you walk around on your quest. The people of Britannia will wake up in the morning, go to work, go to the local pub, come home and relax, and then sleep. They each have their own possessions, most of which you can take unless they have a locked chest and a hidden key. But going with the moral themes of the Ultima series, stealing items in front of other people will not only cause them to call the town guards on you, but steal enough and your companions will tell you they don\\'t agree with your morality anymore and they will leave you. Each town in Britannia is fully realized, with homes, pubs, shops, religious centers, and sometimes entertainment (such as the theater in Britain). Origin has also elected to give you the opportunity to participate in these enterprises. That\\'s right, if you\\'d like you can take a job with the baker in Britain and help him make loaf after loaf of fresh bread by literally mixing flour with water, rolling out the dough, putting it in the oven, and retrieving it. That is how ridiculously detailed Ultima 7 is. The world is big enough that you can easily get lost in the forest, mountains, or swamp if you stray from the dirt roads. However, this is often where you will run into the little hidden gems of Ultima 7, the random occurrences and hidden areas that you wouldn\\'t normally find. It is either in Part 1 or Part 2 where you may run into a lone house in the middle of the forest with a computer inside playing Ultima 8 and a dead pirate lying on the ground. If you click the computer either Iolo or Shamino say, with typical Ultima sarcasm, \"Ultima 8? Sounds about right, I\\'d say.\" And that is just Ultima 7 Part 1. Ultima 7 Part 2 takes place after the events of Part 1, thrusting you into the Serpent Isle with only Shamino, Dupre, and Iolo as company, and lucky you, as soon as you touch down a lightning teleportation storm hits and teleports all three companions elsewhere, leaving you alone. Your first order of business is to begin finding your friends and to continue chasing the villains from Part 1 (I don\\'t want to give away too much). But Serpent Isle has its own deal going on. The first city you encounter, Monitor, is a city of warriors; the only way to gain their trust and get them to actually help you is to pass their test of knighthood and become one of them. As you progress through Part 2, you will take on many more quests, meeting many more people and discovering many more plots in places like Fawn, the city of beauty, and Moonshade, a city full of mages. The core gameplay of Part 2 is the same as Part 1 and has the same sorts of cool stuff as I listed above. The graphics engine was updated a bit between Part 1 and Part 2, but not enormously. Finally, there are the two expansions to round out the package: the Forge of Virtue for Part 1 and the Silver Seed for Part 2. These are not integral to completing either game, but add a little more to the storyline and your experience in the game. You can ignore them if you choose. It really doesn\\'t matter. Bottom line: whether you are seeing Ultima 7 here as the Complete Ultima 7 or in  Ultima Collection , it is more than worth your time. It is, as I said, the greatest game I have ever played, lovingly detailed to the most minute factor and easily addicting through its sheer vastness. This game will suck hours and hours out of your life, but at the end of it you will be glad you invested the time, because the gameplay will stick with you long after the Avatar saves the day yet again.',\n",
       " 'This COMPLETE ULTIMA VII includes the main Ultima VII: Black Gate as released as well as the Add-In expansion packs of Forge of Virtue , Serpent Isle , The Silver Seed. The experience is a bit different from previous Ultima games. The world you explore is VAST and incredibly detailed. The wide-open nature of the game can be a strength and weakness - it is daunting to be confronted with so much sheer land to cover but at the same time... who wants it to end?!',\n",

Add that to the fact that the seller did not even bother to blank out the character names on the screenshots, so Bliz will know which account is being sold.

One drawback is none of the goodies that came with these guides are in this collection, kind of a bummer really. Another drawback is the Twilight Princess guide isn't the 2008 re-release but instead the original 2007 release. A third drawback is that yes they are Prima guides and we all know how much they can leave out information.

I have bought the hard cover collector\\'s edition Prima Guide for Zelda as far back as Twilight Princess and gotten nearly every one since. I had 4 of these books already, and 2 paperback books of the other 2 guides. So in a way I was buying a set of books I already had. Still has a collector and a fan, I could not pass it up and for me, I could not be happier I got this. In reading some other reviews about this item, I hope to clarify a few things about this set. 1. First off, I will say that my original set did come with a damaged chest. I got a replacement from Amazon, so no biggie and I\\'m not going to ding a star off for that. It was just bad packaging. 2. The metal book mark is fantastic, and better than I expected. The chest is nice and having the ribbon inside to help pull out the first book is a nice touch. Note it\\'s meant to just pull out ONE book at the back, which if you keep them in order should be Wind Waker HD. 3. As noted, this set does not come with the extra items such as cloth maps that the original individual books came with. Not a big deal to me, but it is what it is. What it does come with, and just that this set is a limited edition makes up for it to me. 4. I want to give a breakdown of these books and how they compare to the original individual ones I have, where applicable. - The Phantom Hourglass Guide is identical to the original lone book. - The Twilight Princess Guide IS The revised guide that apparently came out in 2007. I got my original when Twilight Princess came out and didn\\'t even know till I read the other reviews on here that there even was a revised edition. The 16 or so new pages are mostly a greatly expanded and more detailed \"legendary checklist\" at the back of the book. - Spirit Tracks: This one through me for a bit because the book in the set is about 1/4 an inch thicker than my original, but the contents and number of pages are identical so they must be using thicker paper. The only difference that I noticed is that the table of contents is the very last page of the book. I am honestly not sure if that is an error or intentional. - Ocarina of Time 3D. One of the books exclusive to this set and never available as a hard cover on it\\'s own. This is a very nice book and one of the reasons I wanted this book. In comparing in to my paper back version, the contents are the same but the page layouts are different here and there. - Skyward Sword. I did not get this one originally in hard cover, which was available on it\\'s own. But I have read and discovered it\\'s a greatly changed book from the original. It say it\\'s revised and expanded by over 100 pages, but in reading on Prima\\'s website the making of this set, they go into detail about how this book was basically rewritten by a new author and has all new screen shots. It\\'s much more than just expanded by 100 pages. This was my biggest surprise in this set, as I thought the Ocarina of Time book would be the only really unique book in this set, but it\\'s really that one and this one. - The Wind Waker HD. This book came out individually very recently so naturally the one in this set is identical to the stand alone. And that is about it. Like a said, a very great set and I am thrilled to own it.',\n",
       " \"This is a really nice collection, a must have for all Zelda fans. It just has some little details I didn't like: 1) My Ocarina of Time 3D guide is backwards, like they messed up when they bound the cover. It doesn't make it useless but it feels weird. 2) Why didn't they include space for the Link between worlds guide? It's a shame my copy of that guie has to be outside the chest. Everything else is great.\",\n",
       " \"This box is a must-have for any Zelda fan. Not only does it include 6 limited edition strategy guides with bonus content not available anywhere else, but it also comes with a beautiful golden etched bookmark and a certificate of authenticity with the limited number and message from the producer of the game. Each book ends up being about 20 dollars so the fact that it's all a limited release, the price is definitely worth it! As a Zelda fan, I would definitely recommend fans to go out and spend the money because you'll be sorry if you don't! If you're not a Zelda fan, well now's the time to become one!\",\n",
       " \"The Legend of Zelda Box Set looks spectacular, awesome, masterpiece & magnificent . It's truly miracle, fantastic & unbelievable & incredible.

       " \"I'm a huge Zelda collector so this set was a must-buy. It's a bit of a bummer that none of the guides came with their cloth maps like in their original release, but that's a small complaint. The revised edition of Skyward Sword is a big improvement over the original, and the gold metal bookmark is a nice bonus. I'd definitely recommend this if you're a Zelda fan.\",\n",
       " 'First off, I want to say that everything about this set is gorgeous! It all starts with the idea of now your own personal treasure chest to decorate your shelf with. Once open, there are six hard bound strategy guides that span the \"Legend of Zelda\" franchise. 1. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D (First time ever released) 2. The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks 3. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass 4. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD 5. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess 6. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (Expanded by 100 pages from the original guide) All of the books have gilded edges to give a gold sheen along each page. Most of these guides are out of print and hard to find. The guides are all the official Prima Games guides versions, which is a company dedicated to making video game strategy guide. As a result, the content is undoubtedly top notch in every guide to help you find every secret and defeat every boss. If you are a fan of the franchise, this is an absolutely awesome set to pick upl',\n",

I had several of the other guides individually prior to the set being announced, so when I bought this, I started selling the originals... I wish I hadn't. This set doesn't come with all the goodies (maps, etc.) that the originals came with. I wish I had paid a little more attention to that (completely my fault, I'll own it). With that said, it's still a cool set, and if you didn't manage to get the guides on the first run, it's still worth picking up!\",\n",

Fully Colored, each one has it's own design and color through out the books! it would have been nice if the book cover colors matched the games better. Such as Ocarina Of Time's is purple....Why is it Purple? but it does have the original AND mirrored play though so that's good. It's in the shadow Temple, Spirit Temple Order. Twilight is a Nice Brown color, I can see why spirit tracks is Green. I and my husband think Ocarina Of Time book and the Hour Glass book should have switched cover colors. No. 34,622 /50,000\",\n",

The guides speak for themselves, they walk you through all aspects of these games, giving you tips and help to complete the games. All of the books are high-quality hard cover, with gold-edged pages.

I had left it closed until earlier today because I just had to hold the guides in hands. I took the plastic off and opened the chest. I was without a doubt worthy of 5 stars, that is until I look more closely. At first, I had only taken out the Wind Waker HD and spent 15 minutes preparing the spine for reading. When I was finished, I took out the next guide, Skyward Sword, and immediately saw a scratch on the upper backside of the spine. Upon further observations, I noticed that there were small dents near the bottom of the spine and even what appears to be some hot glue coming from the bottom of the binding. I was expecting something I would be fond of for years to come not something that would ruin my day the first day I were to open it. Pros: - best price - great themed case - love the style of the covers - loved the bookmark and letter of authenticity cons: - poor craftsmanship ruined my day Conclusion: It's an amazing product if and only if you don't mind what appears to be poor handling before distribution.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very quality collection of these hardcover strategy guides. I already owned all of them except the Ocarina of Time 3d guide, so I don't mind not getting the other things that came with the originals. Also, I'm not sure why other reviews have complained about this, collector's editions are collector's editions for a reason. If you wanted the extras, you should buy the original version of the CE guide. The metal bookmark that comes with these guides looks beautiful though it had a couple very small blemishes on the surface of one side. Magnetic lid closes nicely. The only thing I could want more in this is if it made the sound from the games of obtaining an important item from a chest when you opened it. That would make this complete. Great product!\",\n",
       " \"I was a bit disappointed that Prima didn't redo all their Guides and include them in this set. Just because the games are old doesn't mean they are not loved and well played to this day. It frustrates me that I now have other Prima guides sitting outside this box not in the cool collector's covers that don't fit this theme at all. I didn't take off for that though because I purchased this product knowing the older guides were not included so that wouldn't be fair. As far as what is included it is perfect! The chest is sturdy and will last forever if you take care of it and is just an awesome touch. The book covers are just so perfectly Zelda it is amazing. The Gold leafed pages are just showing off a bit but Gold is a main part of the Zelda theme so it fits even if it is a bit gaudy. The bookmark is epic and if it wasn't so big I would use it as an actual bookmark for everything I read I love it so much. The signed certificate is a very nice feature for collectors as well even if it was signed using a machine (no way that poor guy signed 50,000 of these things). The actual content of the guides is first rate. The are very complete, have wonderful pictures, and if you want to know how to get a specific item or sidequest or something it is in there. Wonderful product even if it is incomplete.\",\n",

The way the books slide out with a pull ribbon is a nice added touch, the gold book mark, the gilded pages of each book is stunning The down side is that it's so beautiful it's hard to want to use the books for strategy guides! It's very intimidating! I've heard this is the only way to get HD Windwaker guide and 3DS Ocarina of Time? So if that is true then that will be a selling point for players The treasure box is very adorable and the magnetic clasping is very nice I wouldn't recommend using the Zelda bookmark...as it might tarnish easily or get handling marks on it Even though a lot of the Prima guides don't flow well in some of the strategy : IE they leave parts out or forget to cover some events or omit some map layouts, I still recommend this for the visual appeal\",\n",

Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases. The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date. I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000. When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted. They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well. Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items. Here's hoping they also release books for Majora's Mask when it inevitably releases on the 3DS as well as the new Zelda adventure for the Wii U later this year or Spring 2015, whenever it is ready.\",\n",

My only possible complaint is the treasure chest box should make the treasure finding sound (you all know exactly the sound I'm referring too). And maybe have the box oversized so it could fit in the Link between worlds collectors edition strategy guide (same size and design as these so is part of the collection.)\",\n",

If it comes from prima directly it's packaged very well. Im not sure where mine came from but it was in a much larger than needed box with extra paper holding it in place... And the bottom of the chest was damaged because of it. Finally, the set seems cheap. One of the books in my set had some of the pages bent and the inside cover was dog eared.

This set is just not good quality all around. Let\\'s start off with the bad: -All of the books have a huge scent of glue upon opening it, as well as \"goops\" of glue all around the binding clumping pages together. -Gild is already wearing off on some of the books upon opening the set -Badly bound - this is the biggest deal breaker here. It\\'s not sewn and it\\'s a \\'perfect binding\\' which is the least reliable of the sort. Pages will fall out with light use as has been the case with many, many books with this type of binding. -General scuffs around the books and bookmark - not up to \\'collector\\' standard, a lot of tiny scuffs here and there on all items inside. The Good: -The box (chest) feels very good, much better than other cardboard box sets. It feels nice and rigid for what it is. No problems there. -The game guides themselves provide great amount of content -The bookmark, besides the few little scuffs, is fantastic. Really nice. All in all, the binding is the biggest deal breaker for me. It is basically just a paperback glued to a hardcover and provides no real advantage over paperbacks. Pages falling out with ease is not my definition of a collector\\'s set and definitely would not pay the asking price for it.',\n",

The walkthroughs are in depth, and perfect for someone who is stuck, wanting to 100% complete the game, or just for a collector's item. I also love the golden design of the bookmark. It is glossy and serves its purpose well. The chest is handy for holding all these guides, and serves as a nice showpiece. I was also very enthusiastic to receive a certificate of authenticity, included in each set. If you're a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I would definitely reccommend this before it's sold out!\",\n",

       " \"As a big Zelda fan this treasure chest is magnificent and since I own all of these games it was a no brainer for me. As i've gotten older it's been harder to enjoy Zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i don't have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade. The golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from Wind Waker. The guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through. If you love LoZ and own these games get this before they're gone.\",\n",

       " \"This is absolutely fantastic. When I picked up the amazon box at the door, I was taken by surprise by its weight...perhaps I should've looked at that in the description! I gently opened it and unsnapped the magnetic seal to reveal a gorgeous gold-plated bookmark with etched logos. The hardcover guides are beautiful with gilded edges and he certificate of authenticity is nicely tucked away in an envelope. As others have said, it would be nice if they included room for A Link Between Worlds, but it's not that big a deal. If you are a diehard Zelda fan, GET THIS WHILE YOU CAN!\",\n",
       " 'Arrived in some very secure packaging from Prima themselves. Overall it is what I expected except for a few small things: 1. None of the bonus maps/posters/bookmarks that originally came with the Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, or Spirit Tracks guides are included. 2. One highly usual thing is that the Twilight Princess guide is a reprint of the original one from 2006 and not the revised edition from 2007 which had 16 more pages of expanded content. Seems like a really weird move to not have used that revised edition for this boxset. 3. And finally, why no space for the Link Between Worlds guide? Would have been great since that came out at the same time.',\n",
       " \"I cannot express to you how happy I am to have received such an amazing box set. The Legend of Zelda has always been a very special franchise to me, and I could not pass the opportunity up when I saw this item. I really cannot say much more than the other 5-star reviews already have, but wow, what a great steal. BUY THESE BOOKS NOW. Seriously, right now. The price listed here on Amazon is unbeatable, and the prices will surely go up. I paid just shy of $18 for each book considering the total price I ended up paying (oh yeah, and free shipping). This is BEFORE all of the other features of the set, such as the sturdy bookmark, certificate of authenticity, and chest container. I think it is very well worth it by all standards. Now, my set had only a few minor flaws that I felt should be pointed out but do not subtract my overall score because they are, as I mentioned, relatively minor. My bookmark has several small scratches on the back of it that I had noticed directly after I had pulled it out. It's a shame... It's quite a nice looking bookmark. Another thing to note is the fact that some of the golden gilded pages were not entirely, well, gilded. There were a few spots on various books that had tiny amounts of the golden paint missing. Where it is lacking, the edges look slightly darker than the surrounding area. Overall, just a tad bit disappointing, but nothing that will make me disregard the amazing features of the entire set. I love these game guides and hope to find ones more like them in the future.\",\n",
       " \"Great set for any Zelda fan. Although I am sad that the maps that came with the first prints weren't included it is still fantastic set!\",\n",
       " \"This collection is OUTSTANDING in terms of quality and appearance. Over the years, I have purchased most of these guides and got the additional materials that were included with them (though these were not replicated for the guides in this collection unfortunately). If ever you were looking for a nice collection of books concerning The Legend of Zelda or to aid in completing the games, this set is DEFINITELY for you. PROS: 1) Quality: The outer box resembles a treasure chest, the likes of which Link finds all across Hyrule (and many other worlds connected to it). It is a sturdy cardboard coated with a gloss-like finish, and it seems to have a magnetic clasp built in to keep the top closed. On the roof of the top, when opened, is a slot containing a metallic (yes, metallic, not vinyl or cardboard) bookmark that has been beautifully etched by what appears to be laser. It contains the logo of the series on one side and the crest of the Royal Family of Hyrule on the other, making for a very attractive (and unexpectedly greater quality) bookmark. The books themselves all appear to be of slightly better quality than their original prints (which had binding problems and easily tore in some instances). 2) Additional Goodies: The most obvious additional item (and most sought after in time I am sure) would be the guide for Ocarina of Time 3D, which is only available through this set (of which only 50,000 exist). I have examined it, and it is a VERY nice guide for the game, and as beautifully put together as its companion guides. Another obvious extra is the metallic bookmark, which is really one of the nicest bookmarks I have seen honestly. Also, something else extra that may be easy to miss is this: some of the materials in this print of the guides have been expanded upon (the number of pages in Skyward Sword's guide has increased by 100 if that tells you anything). 3) Collectible Status: The set comes with a certificate of authenticity that includes a stamped number out of 50,000 and with the printed message and signature of Eiji Aonuma. It marks the set as one out of 50,000 which indicates its collectible status and will almost certainly indicate an increase in value as time goes on. 4) Packaging: I have NEVER seen such good packaging for any item I have bought online as I have for this one. The box the collection was shipped in is a good middle size containing two foam-like holding pieces that fit onto each end of the chest/box which hold it in place (and suspend it both above the shipping box's bottom and below the shipping box's top) and ensures that the package will not move around inside the shipping box at all during transport. I intend to keep the shipping box and packaging the collection came in to transport it again when I am ready to move. You can definitely rest assured that the collection will not suffer damage during shipping. CONS: 1) Lack of Previous Additional Materials: As indicated before, the previous materials included with the previous print of these guides were not included, nor the map from the recently released Wind Waker HD guide. This is a small complaint, as Twilight Princess's guide originally came with a cloth map of Hyrule, the Phantom Hourglass guide came with a vinyl bookmark of its own, and the Spirit Tracks guide originally came with a printed map of Hyrule. While this is a regrettable exclusion, one should also take note that those materials were fairly cheaply made. Hence, you're not missing out on much in that regard. 2) Exclusion of ALBW Guide: It is a shame that the makers of the collection did not have the foresight to include the recently released collector's guide for A Link Between Worlds in this collection, and considering they came out basically at the same time they easily could have. This is a minor complaint, as the guide for A Link Between Worlds is of course available for purchase and comes with a collector's lithograph of the primary image from A Link Between Worlds. Still, it would have been nice to have gotten them all together in one fell swoop, though of course this would have increased the size and weight of the package even more than it already is (and trust me, it weighs a good amount). BOTTOM LINE: This is an AWESOME set that will make any collector ecstatic to possess for not only its vast wealth of knowledge concerning the games it covers, but also for its beauty, craftsmanship and quality. If you have not already gotten these guides, I STRONGLY encourage you to pick up this set while you are able to (there are only 50,000 in existence). And if you have already gotten some of these guides as I had, I encourage you to still pick up this set and possibly sell your older copies as I plan to. I plan to keep the extras that came with the previous printings of the guides and sell the guides themselves, as I now have this collection and no longer have any need for them. The mere inclusion of the Ocarina of Time 3D guide (which apparently is not going to be released outside this set according to the publishers) alone should be a pretty good reason to get this collection, and after seeing it in person, I couldn't agree more that it was indeed worth it.\",\n",
       " 'Just got my set today and it is wonderful! The magnetic chest looks very nice, and the metallic bookmark is gorgeous! The gilded pages are beautiful and I love the hylian symbol on the front. The only defect (for me anyway) is the spirit tracks guide. The cover was either bound wrong to the pages, the pages were bound wrong to the cover, or the gold details on the front were put upside down - as when you hold the guide upright or what should be the \"upside\" based on the hylian symbol, the pages are upside-down and facing to the right! I still love the set though and the others are fine. But it is weird opening the guide and having either the pages or the hylian symbol upside down lol',\n",
       " 'A must have collection for any hardcore Zelda fan. Nicely put together hardcover books with certificate and metallic bookmark as well.',\n",
       " 'Unlike the packing for the seperate collectors guides(crappy amazon book envelopes that get into bear fights with ups and ends up on your doorstep in \"used\" condition) this set comes protected to the hilt and looks great. Kudos to prima for the set AND for making sure we got it in great packaging!',\n",
       " 'High quality magnetic chest box! This is so gorgeous and would be an excellent gift for any Zelda lover! Hurry and get your copy before they run out. Only 50k were made!',\n",
       " 'Came packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything. I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I\\'ve heard that the quality for them were not that great. The bookmark and certificate all make up for it, also the \"chest\" the items came in. For $107, this is a bargain! The books separately are at least $30 each. This is a perfect LoZ collectors item.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games. My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately. I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.\",\n",
       " 'this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!',\n",
       " \"This is an amazing edition to and Zelda fan's collection. I don't understand why they didn't either a)leave a spot for the link between worlds guide or b)include it in the bundle. Especially since it was released at the same time as the game\",\n",
       " \"JUST AMAZING! I didn't expect each guide to come with the special maps or extras that went with them on the original prints. I just knew I was getting guides, a fancy bookmark and fancy box. This is the set for the die hard. I'm super excited and glad I purchased this!\",\n",
       " \"In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item. For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it. Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well. For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun. For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy. There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold. It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide. With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart. The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon. Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases. There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest. When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there. The covers all look very similar. Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them. The covers and the borders are different on each guide. The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD. All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves. The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped. This seems a little odd. It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose. Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange. Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras. Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here. Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package. So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck. That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides. The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide. Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide. Ever. This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover. Originally the guide was only in paperback. This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here. This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published. It has been revised and expanded. Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself. It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages. It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released. So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals. Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide. The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns. Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns. It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result. Much of the text isn't so cramped. Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier. It just looks better and more organized overall. The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking. The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes. Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped. In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location. Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required. The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases. The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well. So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes. Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note. The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered. The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark. For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal. It's invaluable. The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with. It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package. Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy. But let's be clear. If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves. After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy. They are a collector's item. And it is certainly a nice one.\",\n",
       " \"I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!\",\n",

       " 'Every now and again, a simulation comes along that commands respect by delivering variable degrees of realism coupled with really good AI (Artificial Intelligence) and lots of replayability. Aces Of The Deep is one of them. More than 10 years after its release, I find myself returning to it again and again, and I never seem to tire of it. Why? Well, AOTD is blessed with a good design...good graphics for its time (640x480x256 colors), good AI, an easy-to-use interface, and very few bugs. Nothing ruins your gaming fun like having it crash just as you\\'re whipping your AI opponent\\'s butt, but this has never been much of a problem with AOTD. Speaking of the AI opponent, the AI in this game, at the higher \"realism\" levels, is good enough to hunt you down and depth-charge you to pieces. Still, I find enemy destroyers are vulnerable to down-the-throat torpedo shots. It\\'s a good tactic to practice and it has saved my butt many times. Aces Of The Deep is very historically accurate. When the war starts, you are Kapitain of a slow & weak Type-II sub. As the war progresses and you & your crew gain experience & survive patrols, more powerful sub designs and better torpedoes become available. Also, as the war progresses, the Allied sub-hunters (surface ships and planes) get better and better at hunting you down and sending you plunging to Davey Jones Locker. The first version of Aces Of The Deep was the DOS/Diskette version. An expansion disk was later released which added the Mediterranean Sea theatre and also patched several known bugs. The \"Command\" version -- \"Aces Of The Deep: Command\" -- is CD-based and runs natively on Win95/98. AOTD Command includes both the orignal AOTD missions as well as the expansion/add-on missions, it rubs smoother and crashes less than the DOS version, AND it includes voice-recognition, which allows the player to use a microphone to command his U-Boat crew. Whichever version of AOTD you buy, I guarantee that you\\'re in for quite a gaming experience, playing a deadly game of cat & mouse under the cold, unforgiving waves of the North Atlantic. Good luck Kaptain, you\\'ll need it.',\n",
       " \"First of all- why is this under books? Last time I looked it was a computer game, and a pretty good one as well. The plot is unoriginal- humans create super intellegent cyborgs to fight for us, but they turn against us. Thi is where you, as an expert fighter, come in. The game sees you driving and flying armored robots in an effort to save the world. There is a range of types of missions. Sometimes it is to defend a base against an attack, on other occasions it is to guard a particualr strategic site or a HERC holding a particular technology advance, all of which should be familiar if oyu've played this type of gaem before. For its age the graphics aren't too bad, with a range of terrain portrayred well and reasonable detail on the HERCS and buildings. You have three team-mates, who you can issue intructions to during a mission, such as to attack a particular target or defend a particular location. It is also prudent to protect these, as if they die they are replaced by rookies without as much fighting efficiency. But the game is now 5 years old, and understandably it can't match more recent releases. The video sequences are technologically behind, but are only used as mission briefings (brief being the operative word). Many gameplay innovations are absent, and for sheer thrill factor it is lacking. Still good if you find it on the cheap, but not a real contender these days\",\n",

       " \"The Editor in Chief A1 software is based on the workbook of the same name. Each lesson includes a short newspaper-style article, and it's up to the player to locate and identify all the grammatical errors the article contains. Unlike the workbook, in which one must identify only where errors are present and how to solve them, the software adds an extra step: You must actually identify precisely what the error is by choosing a description of the flaw from a wide variety of specific categories within the arenas of punctuation, sentence structure, grammar, parts of speech, and the like. (i.e., is the problem that the wrong verb tense was used? Was it an incomplete sentence? Was such-and-such punctuation/word used in the wrong place? Was there an excess of commas or too few? and many other specific descriptions.) It can be frustrating when you know where an error is, but can't figure out what specific category to place it in. Some kids will take in in stride, but others are prone to get quite annoyed. If this is the case, you may want to look at the lesson with your child and help them through the process of categorizing the error. When you finish a lesson, you can play a spelling game where you shoot words with a pencil. Not exactly insanely fun, but a refreshing break, and it's nice that it's still semi-educational. Overall, if you're teaching grammar for approximately Grades 4-5, Editor in Chief A1 is a good choice.

       " \"This is a really useful tool to learn meditation and quieting the mind in the midst of an active stimulating environment. The whole point is that you're racing a car and trying to beat other computer controlled cars around the track. With the skin conductance and heart rate monitor (which attaches to your fingertips) you control the car's speed. You increase your speed by slowing down your breathing, heart rate, and skin conductance and getting into a meditative state. Yet the faster you make your car go the louder the music becomes and the more exciting the games gets (i.e. the competition with other cars and drive to achieve the goal of finishing the race increases). And thus the better you do at racing the car the harder it gets to increase its speed due to the increasing difficulty of relaxing. This is directly applicable to test anxiety which is aided by learning to relax even in stressful situations. However, if you are new to biofeedback (or don't have a lot of practice) consider starting with a program such as Healing Rhythms first. Dual Drive Pro is VERY challenging and takes practice before you can succeed. It may be discouraging at first, which isn't ideal when learning relaxation. Part of the difficulty though is also part of the appeal as the game is incredibly sensitive and gives almost instant feedback on the slightest increase in tension or excitation. It's fun.\",\n",

       " \"This game was never really a fan favourite. I can see why, but it's also clear to me why it was one of my cherished games as a late teen. The collective of writers, graphic artists and composer(s) in Bloodnet are nothing short of brilliant when it comes to setting a particular mood. I would label this unique mood as urban-dystopian-futuristic-cyberpunk-gothic-mystic that ends up being both oppressive and enchanting at the same time, quite a feat. It's amazing what Microprose can bring out of the dedicated player with little more than a mixture of pre-rendered and handdrawn futuristic stills and peculiar midi music to match. Especially back as a teen, Bloodnet's distinctive atmosphere engulfed my very spirits and managed to linger around me even when I was not actually playing it. Few games (or movies, or books) are capable of this as it takes a certain kind of giftedness, one that this staff happened to possess. VTM: Bloodlines comes to mind, and a couple of others. I also like the fact that Bloodnet is a game of alloys: alloying classic adventure with RPG, distant future with Medieval vampire myths, a bright and loud metropolis with a dark and silent mystery, a detailed and possible future with implausible supernatural goings-on. This aspect was accomplished well. On the bad side, the game feels like it is not interested in letting us actually play it, but only showing off its great graphics, ambient music and, above all, writing. At the same time, it has high ambitions of attempting to merge the genres of point-and-click adventure and strictly stat-based RPG. The end result is a weird mishmash of endless conversations, heavy turn-based combat, and wandering about on motionless landscapes. Weirdness can be a good and a bad thing, and in this case it's both. Part of the appeal, I think (at least for me). My biggest beef with the overall experience is the pre-scripted, absolutely non-interactive dialogs. Again, the sprawling, gritty conversations in this game are masterfully written and are more memorable than the ones in most big-time movies I've seen, but leaving them non-interactive is the biggest deal-breaker, a missed chance for an additional layer of depth and player involvement. Bloodnet is not a good game. It feels static and almost non-interactive. It is, however, a good experience. So good that it ended up as one of the very few games from the early 90's that I actively revisit from time to time. The ultimate praise I can give the game, I think, is that it is a spiritual and atmospheric precursor to the Deus Ex series and VTM: Bloodlines, which are of course much better games, but Bloodnet holds its own against them in terms of mood, writing and originality. No small feat for a 1993 DOS game.\",\n",

Not a bad expansion to get if you want to extend the life of Descent. The other thing is the quality of the pieces.

       " 'The  FATE  roleplaying system does a lot of things exceptionally well. The philosophy behind this system says that while roleplaying may have evolved from 1970s tabletop miniatures wargaming, roleplaying rules shouldn\\'t always play like a Napoleonic battlegame with roleplaying elements grafted on. FATE\\'s ethic eschews crunchy, one-hex-on-the-battle-mat-equals-five-feet wargaming rules in favor of a quick, easy system which focuses on how the players\\' actions impact overall story and plot. It\\'s a radical departure from first- and second-generation roleplaying games, but it\\'s an approach which holds a lot of appeal for me personally-- even if it might not be for everyone. Your mileage may vary. The  Fate Freeport Companion  takes this approach and re-skins it, appropriating many of the tropes of old-school roleplaying games while strictly adhering to FATE\\'s indie gaming philosophy. The end result is a \"Dungeons and Dragons with the serial numbers filed off\" version of FATE set in Green Ronin\\'s popular  Freeport  setting for D&D. I really like the way that FATE Freeport captures all of the essential cliches of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying experience, while simultaneously shedding Dungeons & Dragons\\'s crunchier rules system. If you\\'re somebody who thinks of roleplaying as a shared storytelling experience-- instead of thinking of it purely as a game-- you\\'ll probably enjoy Fate Freeport, too-- especially if you have the same fond memories of Dungeons and Dragons that I have without being particularly enamored of the Dungeons & Dragons rules system. FATE Freeport is definitely worth owning if you like story- and narrative-driven roleplaying games, but still have a fondness for the early days of old-school D&D. If you already enjoy FATE, Freeport is a must-have, because it\\'s the most complete fantasy setting published for FATE so far.',\n",
       " 'An amazing companion to Fate Core. It provides a brief yet complete overview of new fantasy mechanics for your game including a magic system and how to deal with equipment both magical and mundane. Most of the book consists of a pre-made campaign and pre-made characters for the campaign, but there was plenty of material to help adapt my own fantasy setting for Fate.',\n",
       " 'I purchased this book because I am interested in a middle ground between a freeform rpg and a crunchy pathfinder. I love fate and how aspects work I think this is a attempt at using that system in a more traditional fantasy setting',\n",
       " \"The Fate Freeport Companion offers a great setting (who doesn't love a fantasy pirate theme?), however, the reworked skillset kind of limits the game somewhat. It seems like every other creature or NPC has a main stat that is great (+4 to rolls) or better for combat. This is countered by them not being able to take consequences like your character can, but it makes combat encounters pretty much a straight forward affair and the game is obviously based off a D20 type playstyle. D20 is great for what it is, a crunchy rule system for straight combat systems with little room for sway, however the Fate system is way more story focused and is about applying your characters strengths and weaknesses in unique ways. Combat and dice rolls are a very small part of the Fate Core experience and the Fate Freeport Companion seems to miss this concept. I still like the FFC because of the world, the characters, the ideas, and the overall concept and I can appreciate that Brian Engard and Clark Valentine were trying to combine these two systems in a way that made for a kind of 'common ground' feel, but it isn't freeform enough for one (Fate) and not rule specific enough for the other (D20). If a retread were attempted to remove the more crunchy elements and the system were to focus on the pure Fate aspects of the city and gaming sessions, I could easily recommend this as must have for a resource book for people wanting a fleshed out fantasy setting for Fate sessions. As it is right now though, I wouldn't recommend this book for Fate fans or D20 fans on the whole. If you are looking for settings for a Fate game, the Fate Worlds books are a better value in that they give you a setting, a general concept of what is going on, examples of characters, main players, etc. while leaving enough open for you to customize your gaming sessions and I feel they are much better values for your money and time. That said, I really do hope this setting is revisited and more refined for the Fate system because it is a very, very nice setting and I will still be pulling stuff out of it for my gaming sessions, but I would recommend newer players avoid this book because the skill change and combat heavy elements might turn you away from what Fate is all about.\",\n",

The intrigue and role playing that it brings is amazing and I was worried when purchasing this product. Needless to say, I was very pleased. As always the components from Fantasy Flight are durable and all accounted for. The book was also quite hefty coming in around 190 pages.

The way the campaign flows is very smooth and I like how the option to use Hero\\'s Call material is open if you choose to. I also love how they do the \"bad guy\" ;) No spoilers! The only negative thing I can bring are that it\\'s not a full reboot of the original which I was hoping for as the original was a ton of products 5 in total with 2 other option 1/2 products you could add in if you wanted to. Overall though, I am still satisfied with my purchase. But at the same time, if this was a reboot of the original I\\'d probably be very disappointed as I already have them! Overall, it has the same feel as there is an enemy within, but the story is completely different and pulled off very well. Comparing this to other campaigns, I honestly would have a hard time doing it. It\\'s basically a long adventure (30-40 gaming sessions depending on what you do), not a full campaign setting that introduces new things.

Quality The book itself is wonderfully bound and detailed.

It contains some great images of weapon schematics to give GMs and players a better idea of what it is they will be getting their hands on. It's new rule sets are a little vague on occasion, but that's fairly normal for such an abstract narrative focus game. 2. Content This is a GREAT. Book for medium-heavy combat oriented groups. Even if a group isn't focused in such a way, the resources provided here are largely helpful to ideas on theme. It also helps detail mercenary groups who may be working against the PCs, so even if a GMs players aren't currently focusing on getting into big trouble, trouble may find them. It also helps lay out the RP elements for prospective Hired Guns and other mercenary types that do not conform to the class. It has a large selection of new near-military grade weapons, explosives (for which new rules have been outlined) and assault ships. 3. Complaints One or two introduced elements are incredibly overpowered or, at the very least, raise difficult questions about their limitations. One of the mods in particular allows players to fire a weapon without using hands but does not identify whether it counts as a second or even third weapon in the case of attacking. But really the biggest problem with both class books so far has been the infamous signature abilities. These range from nearly useless to absolutely narrative breaking, inducing instant, unstoppable mass-slaughter or near invincibility in the case of the HG.

The graphical interface shows a board and a chess position; the text is on the right describing the subject, such as \\'en prise\\' and the problem on the board. The user follows the directions of the text and often gets to make a move on the board. This is not a Michael Dela Maza style tactics drill software like CT ART 3.0 is. It is a beginners introducutory course on chess which focuses on tactical elements. There are series of 10-20 chess problems for the user to answer at the end of each chapter (or lesson) in the books. It\\'s a fine pc of software for a child. Please go to [...] to find out about the product. I don\\'t want to tear the product down, but AMAZON and/or Chess Central is engaing in false advertising here. It\\'s a shame because myself and many others use these reviews as a guide for purchasing products. AMAZON.COM please fix this!!!! Chess Central has made a mistake (or a deceptive calculation) AMAZON Pull the previous reviews from this product now.',\n",
       " 'I really like the way this program drastically improved my tactical vision by just solving about 100 \"Grades By Difficulty\" puzzles a day for a period of a few weeks (!). My rating on ICC went up about 100 points and, equally important, my confidence grows accordingly. Wonder what this will do to my future otb-rating (ELO). Only two complaints: 1)When taking a test there\\'s no \"counter\" visible, so you don\\'t have a clue how many puzzles you still have to go (I like the way other programs of theirs - like \"Intermediate Tactics\" give information like \"#5 of 50\"). 2)When you make a few mistakes, a small window opens up, showing you a similar position as the one you\\'re trying to solve, which you can practice on, but... where the \"main puzzles\" have the (option of showing the) color you\\'re playing at the bottom of the board, these small \"help boards\" always show the position from the White side. I find the above mentioned \"shortcomings\" annoying, but maybe it\\'s just me... Overall, definitely a program worth buying, although I\\'d suggest you get \"Total Chess Training\", which not only contains CT-ART 3.0, but also 4 other interesting programs (Encyclopedia of Middlegames, Encyclopedia of Opening Blunders, Studies 2.0 and Strategy 2.0) for about $95.

       " 'First, the scoring system is a real modivator: depending on how you do on a problem your (estimated) ELO goes up or down. I work harder on the problems because I want the gratification of a higher score, and if I am not paying attention I get hit with a score penality! This constant reinforcement keeps me focused. Second, chess combinations are well tested, and one can check his or her own solution using the built in Craft chess engine. Finally, the system provides hints if you make a wrong move, allowing one to gradually work up to harder problems. This software does not have a 3d graphic interface, but this software has all the other options that will facilitate your study.',\n",

Additionally, it offers exceptional value for your money providing 100s of hour of valuable training for a very modest price. General comment on Tactical Training: Mastering the Tactical training consists of fast and accurate recognition of standard tactical ideas (motifs) and ability to calculate. Your training should be split in two parts - learning the motifs and then improving you ability to calculate. In the early positions you will have to go through simple 1-2 moves tactics involving double attack, deflection, attraction, and other basic tactical motifs. As you progress - you will have to deal with multiple tactical ideas, longer variations and more resourceful defense. The rating you get is more generous than it should have been, but nevertheless a good indicator of your progress. This tool is ideal for practicing! I use this software regularly so do most of my students.

Fritz 10 was about $20 and is a big improvement over Fritz 8 for analysis. By improvement, I mean that it does deeper searches much quicker. (This is useful for analyzing opening lines.) Besides analysis, everything else is pretty much the same. The Fritz programs are probably not the best for playing for anybody rated below 1900. The modes for weaker players are not very interesting because they are designed to make random gross blunders. It is not as fun when the computer plays like a Grandmaster and then hangs a piece. Why can't we have a hundred levels that go evenly from absolute beginner up to Grandmaster?\",\n",

       " 'If you love playing chess and are interested in getting better, Fritz 10 is definitely the one to get. There are a couple of stronger engines, like Rybka 2.1 and Hydra, but any engine strong enough to defeat the world champion is strong enough for me. (Note: Kramnik recently lost to the Deep version of Fritz 10, but basically the difference between the two is less than 30 elo points. And that\\'s on the slowest time control. (On any time control of an hour or less per game, any of the top 5 chess programs dominates Kramnik and Topalov, the 2nd best human chess player. Where the (world grandmaster strong engine) comes in handy is not in playing against it, (A most frustrating endeavor to be sure), but in helping a player \"see\" what the engine is thinking. No human or even chess program can play perfectly, but today\\'s top engines come pretty darn close, as Kramnik can attest to. You can of course tweak the engine to play weaker, but one bad point of Fritz is when it \"dumbs down\" it\\'s engine, it does so at the expense of realistic play. I.E. leaving a piece en prise, which doesn\\'t happen often even among \"mere\" experts. at slow time controls. The user interface on Fritz 10 however is very user friendly. The browser like icons on top of the picture is one example. If you\\'re not sure what an icon is for, just hover the mouse over them and it will tell you. Everything is customizable from the look and feel of the board to the sounds, even to such minute details like the look of the fonts on the notation. All very intuitive. There is an updated database (to 9/06) which includes the controversial Topalov-Kramnik match. You can search among 1,100,000 games by name, opening, position, even endgame pieces. You can play some historical games by such great players like Fischer and Capablanca, and you can see how many \"inaccuracies\" they made. And brilliant moves as well. But for me, the best part of Fritz 10 or any chessbase compatible chess program, is the play server. That alone is worth the price of the program. It\\'s simply the best place to play. At this server, you also get to watch grandmasters play blitz and whenever there is a big tourney like Linares or a world championship match you can watch every move LIVE. And unlike most chess servers, here all your games are kept on a separate database that you played online, and study them with the help of your world class analysis partner, Fritz. This is very long I realize but I haven\\'t come close to touching on all the features like training modes, 3-D graphics, chess variants like giveaway and chess 960, importing chess books etc. If you have Fritz 9 and your one year subscription to it\\'s playchess server has not yet expired, then perhaps you don\\'t need to get Fritz 10. But if you\\'re anyone else who plays chess and loves following the games of great players, then you won\\'t go wrong with Fritz 10.',\n",
       " \"If you're new to chessbase engines, Fritz is absolutely the one to get. It has all the features you want: great database, an engine you can customize to your level, great analysis function, a computer that can beat the socks off you if you need it. And of course, the program is designed ideally for Fritz. If you go for one, only get Fritz. Here's what I thought about some of the new features: The 3d improvements are great for a few games. Then you go back to 2D because it's still easier. I've run this program against several others on my computers. It matches well against Rybka and is superior to everything else. If you already own another recent chessbase engine, though, you won't find anything really new here.\",\n",
       " 'Fritz 10 is the latest and greatest version of the German chess program put out by ChessBase, a specialist in chess database and playing software. It boasts a set of new features and improvements over its predecessor, and all indicators suggest that it delivers. That said, Fritz 10 may or may not be a wise purchase, depending on why you want it. I will start off by saying that if you are interested in this package as a playing partner and you already have a very strong chess engine to spar with, Fritz 10 is likely a waste of money for you. As another reviewer stated, the engine is so strong that it will crush all but the top grandmasters in the world, so casual play will be frustrating for hobbyists. However, if you want it because you plan to do some serious analysis work and you want the latest engine, it is worth more consideration, though there are stronger engines such as Shredder and Hiarcs. Fritz 10 does a nice job of automatically analyzing games, adding some natural language notations with the move notations, although it is debatable whether or not these notations are very useful. The improvements over its predecessor are mainly in the GUI, not the engine (although the engine shows some promising improvements as well but does not drastically demonstrate strength over its predecessor, Fritz 9). There are some new training features such as showing the engine\\'s plans, which is a solid tool in the toolbox when trying to improve. The sparring and friend modes are also very helpful, though I must concur with the previous reviewer in that the engine makes some silly moves when you \"dumb it down\" to meet the player\\'s skill level. The graphics ability of this package are much improved, offering better piece rendering and display. This is not necessarily a very important feature unless you like your eye candy. As a UCI client, ChessBase seems to have ironed out the problems of the past. The GUI even seems to have a fairly good idea of how strong imported engines are, which is made clear when playing rated games. In testing a few imported engines, Fritz 10 did well in managing these engines and everything was stable. Updates to the PlayChess interface include weather reporting. I have to ask: How useful is this in a chess program? Overall, Fritz 10 is a very nice package and is worth the money if you want a strong program that can analyze games and can connect you to other players on the net. There are stronger engines out there (and some of them are free downloads) so if you are looking for the very best engine on the market, this isn\\'t it. Also, if you have an earlier version and you want it because it\\'s \"the latest and greatest\" in the hopes of getting a hugely improved playing engine, you\\'ll probably be disappointed. However, if you want pretty graphics and an intuitive interface or if you are looking for a good training tool that can help you to understand your game a little better, Fritz 10 is a good choice.',\n",

       " 'Fritz is arguably the most commercially-successful and popular chess package available. I started using Fritz at version 6 and have purchased most of the upgrades, up to version 10. With each successive version the whole package has gotten better and better though some of the upgrades were more worthwhile than others (one reason I never purchased version 11). Version 12 is a quantum leap forward, though it is still not perfect. Installation from the DVD was painless and uneventful. However, there is one issue with the installation that bothered me - the installer never installed a desktop icon or a program group, so I needed to navigate to the installation directory, from which I made a shortcut to the application binary on the desktop. After this step, everything has worked smoothly and I can launch the application without issue. The interface has gotten a huge facelift - this is not a color scheme change or rearrangement of the menus and toolbars, but rather it is a complete overhaul with Windows ribbon controls serving up the components. Normally, I would be wary of such a large change to the overall interface, but ChessBase has done an excellent job of designing the interface and it is very well-organized. There is a learning curve, though, for people who have grown very accustomed to the older ChessBase interface, as some things are a little difficult to find unless you have familiarity... Given a couple of hours of exploration, the interface becomes second nature and finding things becomes easy again. The Fritz engine itself is a strong one, able to crush practically any human player (including seasoned grandmasters) with ease when used at full playing strength and it holds its own against other top-drawer engines. It is not the strongest engine available, but for the vast majority of players it doesn\\'t need to be the strongest. When using an engine this strong, playing against it is not the most useful activity; where engines of this strength are most useful is in the analysis of games. Fritz includes several analysis modes, my favorite being full analysis for post-mortem scrutiny of games. The full analysis function works backward through a game and adds move suggestions as well as canned commentary as the selected chess engine evaluates each position. Though the English commentary is not always especially informative (for example, comments like \"This is a futile try to save the game\" are common), the comments do add a more \"personal\" touch to the analysis which would otherwise be simply a dump of suggested moves. When the engine finds an especially good move, the commentary is usually a little more helpful. I found an annoying glitch with the Full Analysis mode. After fully analyzing a game, the interface simply chopped the last quarter of the game from the report, even though I could still iterate through all of the moves. I never could get the rest of the analysis on the screen. Another very helpful analysis mode is \"Infinite Analysis\" which takes a single position and continuously analyzes it until the engine is interrupted or the position is changed. This is especially helpful for taking a deep look at a position and trying several what-if scenarios. Deep position analysis is another mode, as is Monte Carlo, though I have used these so little that I cannot really comment on them. The last analysis mode I will talk about is \"Engine Shootout\" which takes a position and feeds it to two or more engines for analysis. These engines evaluate the position and play through, with the intent of determining how the game would proceed and the outcome as a result. Though it\\'s a feature I really don\\'t need, it is something I use occasionally to look at games I have played when the game was unfinished but the outcome wasn\\'t clear. Different engines arrive at different conclusions which makes this even more intriguing. The Fritz package includes a large database of games, which can be used to explore and analyze. Where I find this database to be most useful is in researching specific styles of play. For example, it is easy to track down all of Tal\\'s games and follow his playing style with the database search functions. Also included on the DVD is a set of training videos. To be honest I have never found these to be especially helpful but others may very well benefit from them. The UCI interface continues to improve, so adding in UCI engines is easy and reliable. I have found several weaker engines against which I can play so I have them bound into the interface for playing. I use the Fritz 12 engine for analysis after the fact. Central to the Fritz interface is access to the ChessBase chess server. Through the interface, players can log into the server, play games, read chess-related news, watch seminars, and observe important matches with live coverage. There are a couple of different versions to this package. The version sold by ChessBase and its resellers sports a green box whereas the version sold through Viva Media comes in a black box. I noticed an appreciable price difference and I investigated that difference. The software appears to be the same; the real difference is in the access given to the chess server. The more expensive package offers a 1-year premium membership which gives access to all content on the server such as seminars, elite tournament coverage and other content. The less expensive package also offers a 1-year membership but the access is more limited and excludes much of the premium content. Both offer guest access which allows anyone to log in and play games without hindrance, but as a guest so there is no tracking of progress. Which kind of access you desire should be considered when choosing which package you need. Fritz 12 is a big step forward and is a worthwhile upgrade from previous versions. The engine is stronger and the interface is vastly superior. It is not without its glitches but the problems seem to be few in number.',\n",
       " 'After I installed the program and played a game and closed the game window there was no way to play again. No icon on the desktop or any play function in the installed game in the computer. Re-installing did not work. Contacted the manufacturer and heard nothing back.',\n",
       " 'This game is the best chess program out there that I know of. It plays excellent chess and the pieces look nice. However, when you move the ELO slide to the minimum, it plays really hard, about 1100 ELO rating. I played it at this level using Online Chess Kingdom and Chess master (PSP games) at the highest level vs. fritz set to the min level, and so they lost to fritz. It was easy to tell Fritz wasn\\'t playing at 1100 ELO, but closer to 2000. The PS3 version of Fritz doesn\\'t have this shortcoming, you feel drastic changes at different ELO ratings, but this computer version you don\\'t feel much ELO change. Another shortcoming is that the game freezes if you choose the \"render light\" option, it slows down significantly if you improve all the graphics in the option menu, and the game flashes once in a while. Some windows don\\'t close despite they have the \"x\". The clicking sound can be deactivated, but it takes some googling time to find out how. On the positive site, the sense of humor is a unique touch, since playing chess can get really quiet. This game could use more chess sets and picture wall papers like in Chess Master. Everything else, I wouldn\\'t change.',\n",

The program is smart enough to obliterate just about anyone, but you can play the game at several different difficulty levels. It even has a friend mode where the computer determines how strong a chess player you are and plays at close to your level. This is one tough opponent - even in the friend mode. There are also several \"personalities\" you can play against. Each personality has preprogrammed strengths and weaknesses (including how badly it blunders). You can also change several of their attributes to make them a stronger or weaker player. Fritz 12 is packed with training tools. You can set the game up so it suggests opening moves; warns you if a square you are about to move to is under attack; give you hints or suggested moves; tell you what your opponent is planning to do; and much more. The free beginner training videos are good. There are also several sample videos for other topics included, in hopes you decide to purchase additional training videos. Even at full price this is a terrific training tool and should certainly help you improve your game, even though you may get a bit frustrated if you like to win.',\n",

Some people had trouble installing or running it on Win7, so I hope my experience will help: To install, I ran the installer (setup.exe) in administrator mode and selected the \"allow this application to modify the hard drive\" option. To register, I entered the product serial number from the label inside the case and the validation code displayed in the licensing dialog box. (NOTE: This step could have clearer instructions I suppose, because it took me two tries to get it. The first try, I just entered the serial number and clicked OK. That resulted in an error message but the program ran anyway. The second time I ran the app I again got the licensing dialog box, and again entered the serial number, but this time realized that the dialog box was displaying a code in large funky letters.

I totally agree with all the excellent things other reviewers have said, but do consider this: On June 10, 2011, World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand told Chessvibes.com his preferred engine was Houdini over both Rybka and Fritz. Deep Fritz 13 (not 12) now has Houdini 3 installed into it and is the ultimate way to prepare for an OTB tournamemnt by weeding out any inconsistencies in your favorite openings. Deep Fritz 12 is still important however since you can install the free Houdini 1.5 download (ELO 3250) or the Houdini 3 Pro version (current CCRL rating 3347) in the Fritz engine management tab under the:\"create a UCI engine\" option. Why is a high ELO rating so important?Because when you go to your next OTB tournament, rest assured at least one of your opponents will have his openings down pat with many new ideas and all inconsistancies worked out well in advance and approved by the worlds strongest engine which is Houdini. If you prefer to rely on the weak main lines and sloppy analysis found in both the \"Secrets of Opening Surprises\" or \"Dangerous Weapons\" books then you may learn the hard way (as I did)by losing many games after reaching terrible positions during the critical opening stages of the game. So I agree with all the good things said about Deep Fritz 12, but its really the excellent GUI(Graphic User Interface) provided that makes Fritz invaluable in creating a truly powerful opening arsenal that will give your opponents something to think about.',\n",

I've owned chessmaster for a while and it is worth the money, if nothing else, with the Josh Waitzin tutorials. Chessmaster has great graphics, but everywhere else, Fritz wins out.

To test this further I set up a 12 game head to head tournament with Stockfish and one processor Fritz 12 tied four processor Stockfish 6-6. This won me over. I use Fritz 12 to analyze games almost exclusively. The major disappointment was the Fritz trainer samples which were cut down to about 2 and one half minutes each. They became more like advertising \"teasers\" than real instruction videos. If you are primarily interested in the training aspects of a chess program, I recommend that you get Fritz 10 or one of the latest Chessmaster programs.',\n",

I used this feature a lot to play my other computers with earlier software against each other. When I emailed Chessbase and inquired why they removed a great feature they replied that it was too much trouble for them to support. Just lazy German programming. I thought that software evolved to more features not less? Isn\\'t that what justifies buying upgrades every year? Hmmmm... Well Chessbase ceretainly isn\\'t giving a break on the price. Oh yeah thats another thing, why are they still selling a \"DEEP\" version? All cpu\\'s today have multi-cores and the programming for parrallel processing is already done.

Rybka 4.1 just mops the floor with Fritz 12 in Engine match, it so embarrassingly bad. One recent engine match had Rybka winning 24 straight games and no draws. This was with the same book for both engines. Do to the fact the Chessbase doesn\\'t care to listen to their customers and continue to support features established for over a decade and it\\'s poor showing against Deep Rybka 4.1 I would have to say that Deep Fritz 12 is just not worth buying.

It is the most expensive of the commerical database programs but it is probably the most widely used by top-level players and chess journalists. This large installed base of customers is a definite plus. Specific complaints about Chessbase 12 - Documentation errors. The Help files (and downloadable manual) often refer to features from older verions of Chessbase which have since been updated. Worse I think some of the help is for another product (like Fritz--also made by Chessbase). - Notation Pane often goes blank. You have to click on the Notation Pane scroll-bar to restore the notation. - More board customization. I prefer lower-case board coordinates. Chessbase only has upper-case and it makes the coordinates too distracting. Also there is no option to place coordinates on all 4 sides of the board (The print option allows this). - No explanation of certain features. The engine pane is the worst example. There is an indicatior light that usually is grey but sometimes goes red, green or yellow. The help says this is \"Fail High/Low\". That\\'s it.

A few that are fixed now: - When Chessbase is restarted and a function to display a window is taken, the window will be the same size and in the same location it was last opened at. Before (CB11), multiple monitor systems with different resolution monitors would always put the windows partly off the top of the screen with an extra long vertical dimension, and they always required adjustment in order to be useful. - The x for canceling cb windows no longer disappears when the computer goes to sleep and is reawakened. Before, the x would no longer show after the computer was restarted from sleep mode. To cancel required right clicking on the icon in the task bar and then selecting close window. Edit: 1/22/13 this bug still exists on cb12. - The ribbon menus are more consistent when the option to default to a minimize ribbon is used. Right click on a blank area of a ribbon menu, and select `minimize ribbon' to use that feature. When you want access to a menu, click on the section you want (e.g. Home) and the ribbon menu is displayed as a drop down. Too me, the most noticeable feature added is the 'Let's check' database when running computer analysis. While running analysis, the top moves selected by various commercial chess engines are also displayed with the number of plies searched by each engine and the position evaluation. This database is updated primarily by Chessbase and Fritz user's own computers. When a user's engine calculates deeper into the position (more plies), it's evaluation updates CB's let's check database. Subsequent users (from anywhere in the world!) will see that evaluation next time they arrive at the same position. Updating of Let's Check database can be turned off, but is on by default. One of the nicest features of Chessbase, that competing products seem to lack, is the ability to open chess boards, databases, opening books, etc. outside of the main environment window. This feature has been available since CB8. The reason this is so useful, is because it's very common to have many chessboards and databases open at the same time. Trying to fit them in a single environment window is often problematic. With Chessbase, they can be placed and sized anywhere on the desktop. Even within a chessboard window, the engine evaluations, opening book, and move list can be moved outside of the chessboard, or automatically made to fit in the window that's dedicated to that chessboard. For someone that researches openings, tournaments, players, and/or historical games, I don't think there is a better product. Alternatives I'm aware of are Convetka's Chess Assistant, and several freeware products (SCID and Chessdb are ones I've looked at before).\",\n",

Kind of interesting to look at as you play the fritz engine. Kind of buggy in places but chessbase always updates and corrects any errors. Good on three machines which is vastly improved. Fritz engine seems like the same as always but I usually will download the latest stockfish engine for free and use that anyway. Overall very similar to previous versions but an excellent program in and of itself. Would recommend unless you have 15 or so.\",\n",
       " \"I was skeptical about the new GUI. The old interface is still there nonetheless. I really enjoyed the easy mode. Clicking on the pieces gives you a quick assessment visually on the board. It is great to see potential combinations and focus though on the intended plan. There are other new features too, just look up Chessbase's YouTube videos about the new Fritz 16 interface. I am pleasantly surprised and this replaces Fritz 15 GUI for me. Yes, other engines are stronger and you can get Stockfish 8 and use it under Fritz as a UCI engine. I find this to be Chessbase's best GUI overhaul I can think of (going back to Fritz 7). I am also using this on an iMac running WIndows 10 with VMWare Fusion and there are no issues.\",\n",

The easy mode doesn\\'t allow time controls (if they do, I couldn\\'t figure out how to do it). The \"classic\" interface gives hints when you pick up the piece (I searched the manual and all the settings to turn this off, to no avail - I also sent an email and no answer). After 2 weeks, I am giving up on it and going back to the Fritz 14 interface. To add insult to injury, Houdini 4 beat Fritz 16 in a engine match 6 to 1. This was on 5 min games using 2 CPUs. However, I was pleased to see that when I increased the time to 15 minutes and processing to 4 CPUs, Fritz 16 was undefeated (5 and 0) - Houdini 4 only allowed 3 CPUs)',\n",
       " 'As a Chess playing program it is too strong for most humans so any improvements are almost irrelevant. The user interface is more important in distinguishing between such programs and unfortunately the same basic problems from previous versions still exist. - some databases are buried in system files on the C drive, with no option to set where they are saved. Separate software is required to manage them - No help file, it just wanders off into a redundant web-browser with a pathetic Google-like translation of German into some sort of pidgin English - Confusing implementation of the Ribbon with a mix of styles and formats; regularly have to hunt the right option - Opens irrelevant games when launching program The new bright yellow initial screen is a mostly useless gimmick, and not helped by the buttons to close the program being hidden off screen.',\n",

       " \"This DVD is organized with longer introductions to types of pawn structures or general variations (Carlsbad structure, Capablanca structure, etc.) and short discussions of actual games. Kasparov's take on chess history is fascinating, but his method of presentation is better for strong players than weaker players. This is definitely NOT the DVD to buy a child who is just learning the game. To pull a number out of my head, I'd say you should only buy this if you're rated 1800 USCF or higher, and here's why. I learn the most, and I think most people learn the most, from methodical discussion of important games, then trying to apply that into my own games, then trying to figure out where I went wrong. Kasparov only spends about 4 minutes per game (!!??!!). He's assuming the viewer already knows how to execute plans in the middle game that arise from the opening. I got this DVD on sale, so it was definitely worth the money, and it includes an annotated game collection, so I'm sure I'll be referring back to it for years. But I had to purchase a different Queen's Gambit DVD, just so I would have the background necessary to understand this one.\",\n",
       " \"This is truly a rare treat. Garry Kasparov, quite likely the best openings expert in the history of chess, and World Champion for about 15 years, has here given a very valuable overview of one of the most fundamentally important openings in chess, the Queens' Gambit Declined. The DVD is in the form of a games collection, with all of the major variations covered. Kasparov's presentation is fascinating. He gives a blend of historical background and fundamental instruction. His accent is rather strong, but he is quite eloquent, charismatic and in general easy to understand. You will not get every theoretical variation that you would need to play the Queen's Gambit at a high level with such a general overview, of course, but this DVD is so compelling and well done that any chess player from casual club player up to master (and probably beyond) will benefit from the presentation. Don't miss the chance to get instruction from the player that many consider the strongest player of all time. Even if you don't play the Queen's Gambit you will profit from Kasparov's explanations, and you will enjoy yourself as you learn! Very highly recommended.\",\n",

If you have any interest in the history of the Space Race, this game is worth having! It's a strategic rather than tactical simulation: you administer your space program and watch your missions run, but you don't fly them yourself. If you want to fly spacecraft, a better choice would be Orbiter or Microsoft Space Simulator. But if you're interested in running a space program and watching your ships go to the Moon, this game is fantastic. It's strongly historically based (though tweaked for game balance) and you're not limited to Apollo capsules. You can also fly Gemini capsules to the Moon, or reusable minishuttles, or even a direct ascent spacecraft like in the old sci-fi novels. The original floppy version of this game runs well in DOSBox. The CD version is noticeably better but doesn't run as well in DOSBox. However, the game has been ported to Windows, Mac, and Linux, and is available for free download from its Sourceforge site.\",\n",

After receiving the microphone in question, I plugged it into my USB port, only to find that it didn\\'t work. \"Odd,\" I thought and tried a different USB port. This one worked, and I began playing. Now, to give a bit of backstory. I have two televisions in my room: an HDTV and a normal \"box\" television. After getting fed up with attempting to calibrate the system correctly, I now move back and forth between the two televisions whenever I wish to play a musical rhythm game. Obviously, for vocals, an HDTV can be used uncalibrated, as, if you know the song, you do not need to watch the notes go by, so I had had the Xbox plugged into this. Later, when I decided to switch TVs to play my guitar, I eventually replugged in the microphone in the same USB port that I had plugged it in previously. It didn\\'t work. Now frustrated, I retried every port, only to finally find one that worked, which happened to be the very first port I\\'d tried previously. I later came to find that the microphone I received had a short in the wire, almost as if it were used (which is entirely possible, as I got no packaging, only a plastic wrapper around the microphone). As for the performance itself when I actually get the thing to work, it works nicely. It picks up on my voice fairly well, although you have to keep it at a very precise angle, or it may lose lower volumes. There is enough cord length that I can sing at my preferred distance (although I sit very close to my televisions, so take this statement with a grain of salt). It\\'s not a bad mic, and I\\'m sure the short was just a defect on the part of my microphone. Not bad, overall.',\n",

It contains detachable items, intended to enhance the feeling that you have something really of the Star Wars universe. This adds much to the enjoyment and presentation of the book. The journal was written both as a stand-alone book, and to be part of the Collectors Edition of Star Wars: The Old Republic. I bought the Collectors Edition before the game launched, in preparing my gaming guild (Sons of Numenor/Scions of Korriban) to play it. Of all the real and in-game items included as part of the Collectors Edition, this was the most rewarding. It complements the content presented online at the games website, and fits well among other books related to Star Wars lore. If there is anything disappointing, it is that the book is not longer. As the stories and narratives are fascinating, and do much to add depth and flavor to characters and story beyond it. This book is worth having as a Star Wars collector, on just one seeking to add a bit more depth to their knowledge of its lore. If ones plays Star Wars: The Old Republic, it is very much worth having. These will become more rare by the month. Complete copies, with all of the included detached items, will become even more rare. I would also strongly recommend two specific books in addition to this. They are \"The Jedi Path,\" and \"The Book of Sith.\" (either the stand-alone edition, or the excellent \"Vault\" editions.) Each of those two books, are written and presented in the same artifact style as this journal. They are among the most collectable Star Wars books, and fit perfectly alongside The Journal of Master Gnost-Dural. Do look them up and be aware of them, if you find this book interesting. At the timing of writing this, you can buy this book alone, for prices ranging about $17. The full Collectors Edition of Star Wars: The Old Republic has dipped as low as $29 at in-store locations, and averages in the $80 range on Amazon.

I did check and have the problem across more than one tv, so it's not the tv's fault. I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii, but I doubt so, as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with (why, Wii, did you not include component/hdmi cabling by default? HD isn't that rare). Ah, but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable I could find, and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cabling.\",\n",

The cord works and does help make the picture a little crisper than the regular Nintendo Wii cord. Between the cheap price and the picture quality I get I'm definitely happy with my purchase. Update May 7, 2013 After using the cables for a while I occasionally get a green tinted screen when I load my Wii, although I've been able to get it to go away restartig the Wii and replugging in the cords. Also after using my Wii to watch Netflix more I can say that the color hasn't bee great and is not very accurate to when the show is watched on my laptop or through original broadcast. I also can't really say that its the cords or the Wii that is going bad and making the color go bad. At some point I'm going to try to borrow cords for a friend and test it out. Ultimately though the cords were dirt cheap compared to other I looked at and I would not be surprised or even mad if they went bad after being used for a while.\",\n",

Upon using the cable, I noticed a change in the image. I thought it was clearer and sharper, and though still not the same as X-Box or PS3, it is good enough for me. The cable is a little short, so I can imagine this could be a problem for some. With the price I would definitely recommend purchasing this!\",\n",

       " \"I agree with most other reviewers on this cable in that it helps with the Netflix viewing, but not so much with the gaming. I think this is because of the way the games are made (I could totally be wrong on this). Certain games like Donkey Kong Country Returns look better with this cable, but Black Ops looks the same. There is a noticeable difference in my Netflix streaming though. So, for six bucks this is what I got, and I'm happy with it, but not over the moon.\",\n",
       " \"After few months of use cable flicker and video goes off as i watch my netflix online using component cable. Picture quality is very accurate on my LCD. I don't know if flickering is due to cable or my nitendo but some online site suggested it could be cable.\",\n",
       " 'First, this is a low cost cable, and so is built. The RCA ports are easy to get loose and slip out of the tv connector. Also is not well shielded , you will have to route the cable away from RF interference or power lines, or you\\'ll notice flickering video. Overall in a simple connection it should work fine, but in a entertainment system where are some other devices, as home theater, networking equipment, etc, the cable will pick a LOT of Noise. Also it should be a permanent installation, since it is not sturdy enough to resist multiple pulling in / out of the connectors. Otherwise it will do the trick, and having your WII in 480P will not make it a HD console, that the wii is not capable of, but picture will be clearer, sharper (I don\\'t know, but in my 40\" LCD image out of the standard cable seems a bit blurry)and with more defined colors',\n",
       " \"I have a Wii and a 1080p TV, but I don't play the Wii often enough to spend $30 for component cables that should have come with the system. These work wonders. My boyfriend plays Monster Hunter and now the monsters are defined and colorful. For the price, these are fantastic. I was skeptical when I read reviews about the sound quality, but I have not noticed any problems whatsoever.\",\n",

So it's an ok cable that doesn't make much difference, but I would still recommend it, so that you can use a component input on your tv, instead of composite.\",\n",
       " \"...that Nintendo (or Sony, Monster Cable, etc.) can ask so much for things that don't cost nearly so much to manufacture; the name brand cables are probably made in China right alongside these third-party counterparts. $30 was out of the question for me right now, so I figured I'd take a chance on this. 5 or 6 bucks, WITH shipping. It does come in a clear plastic bag with no labeling or instructions, but it's a high-quality cable that performs perfectly. No problems whatsoever (grant it, I've only had it a day, but I don't forsee anything changing as sturdy as it is). The colors are noticably brighter, and to my surprise, everything does appear crisper! As mentioned, just remember to go to Wii Settings and change TV resolution to 480p.\",\n",
       " \"I was looking for a cheap way to take advantage of the system's 480p capability. I found this after looking on line and it arrived reasonably fast. The cable preforms fine except that when ever anything kicks on, ie dishwasher, refrigerator, furnace, in our house I get flicker on the television set. Now it isn't enough to return the product as I bought cheap and received cheap. I may go back to the cables that came with the system and live with 480i. Just beware that when buying cheap you have to remember that you get what you pay for.\",\n",
       " 'then wii is not hd it only has standard def out on it (for now) so buying this item for an hd tv is very pointless use your a\\\\v cables people! there is a rumor of a hd wii in the making but no offical word as of yet,so before you some totally insane item do your research people.',\n",
       " 'I agree with other reviews that the video for gaming is not improved in \"HD\" using a component video cable with your Wii console. I looked at the bowling game before and after switching, and it looked the same. I got the disc from Netflix for watching movies on the Wii. I compared by starting a movie with the original video cable. The video was fuzzy and just blah on my HD TV. Paused the movie and switched cables. Restarted the movie and it looked the same. Then I realized that I have to go to the Wii set up menu to change from 480i to 480p. After that the picture was much better. Netflix \"Instant\" streaming movies now look as good as playing the DVD. The image is sized to fill my wide screen HD TV. The cable itself has full sized plugs for video and audio. On my TV the jack spacing leaves no gap between plugs, making plugging it in tight. Make sure every plug is fully inserted if you have picture or sound issues.',\n",
       " 'cable arrived in timely manner. Hooked it up to TV but did not work properly. Wii picture was close to black and white only. Appears that the leads were mislabeled or misaligned as sound only came on when the green video connection was plugged in. Would suggest buying different cable. Not sure if will return, cable very cheap relative to cost of shipping return',\n",
       " \"The image quality seems to be leagues better than it was before. When I first hooked up my Wii we (my girlfriend and I) had a 27 inch Sanyo tube television. The picture looked great because of the aspect ratio; video game systems were built around televisions like this. We soon decided we wanted a bigger and better image and upgraded to a 37' Vizio LCD. We were saddened to see picture quality decrease exponentially and quickly became confused as to why our Wii didn't look great on what we knew to be a much better television. We found these cables online and after applying them noticed the picture was 100% better in quality. Long story short: Researched component cables, found them on Amazon for a great price. Ordered cables, arrived very quickly and they worked as described.\",\n",
