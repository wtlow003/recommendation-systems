    "## 2.1 Preparing `TaggedDocument` for Doc2Vec model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this following section, we will generating tagged documents that will be feed into the `Doc2Vec` model. We will be required to generate documents, where each is 'tagged' with the corresponding `asin` of which the review is addressing. This enables the Doc2Vec model to identify documents that are associated to each of the asin within our training dataset, and create a document vector based on the seperated documents for each asin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this preparation is that we assume that each asin is a representation of all the reviews customers has left after purchasing. If customers like any aspect of the product, the reviews should leave relevant positive feedback on that particular e.g., \"the boots is comfortable\" – hence, we know that this particular boots is comfortable. If a product (asin) has many of such reviews, semantically, we can build an item profile that associates this boots as a product that is comfortable. As embeddings are generated in *n*-dimensional vector space, we can then attempt to find similar products within the neighbourhood that has a similar profile be it is either a pair of boots, or a product that is comfortable in nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we are building this in an item-item level is because at a user-level, interests may vary greatly depending on the user needs when purchasing items. Also, as some users may be more negative in nature, their reviews may generally be more critical which will inherently develop a profile that is critical in nature. Assuming this, if we were to place this user profile vector into the *n*-dimensional vector space, we will likely be recommending products that were also critically (or negatively) reviewed. This meant that for this user, we might only be generating poor recommendations due to how its neighbourhood is associated with a negatively semantics. However, in terms of item-level, it is highly unlike that a user has only made poor purchases on the site and hence, its more likely that the items profile develop should have a mix of good and possibly poor semantics. This ensures that we will have positive recommendations generated if we were to implement a treshold of sort, to ensure that the average/weighted average rating of the products meets an initial criteria for recommendations."

    "We will be training a `Doc2Vec` model with initial hyperparameters decided based on a study by [Caselles-Dupré, Lesaint, and Royo-Letelier (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04212), where they observed that `negative sampling distribution`, `number of epochs`, `subsampling parameter` and `window size` can significantly improve performance on recommendation tasks. Hence, we will have decided to start with values that similar to those presented in the studies as the basis for improvement during this project."

What user like now, might not be the same a few days or weeks later. However, on a item perspective, if an item is good, general public who purchased the item should have positive feedback. The nature of the item profile should not vary as much as it would on a user-level. \n",
