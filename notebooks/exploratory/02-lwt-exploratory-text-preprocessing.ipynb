      "['My little Maltese loves this.  I put food into each one and cover it up.  He loves to push the circles off the holes to get to the food.  It is great for a picky eater.  He thinks it is fun and eats!  It would also be good for a fast eater to slow them down.', \"When our cat was a kitten she LOVED the 'Turbo Scratcher'. Over the years she is worn out the pads.These pads are a perfect fit!I periodically sprinkle catnip underneath the pad.We also use the lighted 'StarChaser Replacement Ball' in the Turbo Toy which helps capture kitty's attention :)\", 'Well first off the little black grips that go over the wire ends to keep from scratching the well always fall off. I gave up and just put a little tape over the sharp edge. Second my cats are able to break the mouse from the string easily and do so about once a week. I re attach the toy part by tying the strings back together. That being said the cats freaking love this thing. I would give it five stars if it were not so irritating to have to fix it all the time but the cats would give it five stars for sure.', \"We finally found the perfect bird for me (have not had birds since I was a kid and grew up with parrots--22 of them at one point!)--Conner, a green cheek pineapple conure. I learned that a lot of things have changed in bird toys over the years (about 17 years now) since I had birds, and a lot of toys are very much the same--my kids are grown, but both still live at home--and we have all been picking out bird toys for Conner. I knew to avoid the cheap hard plastic toys, because they really are not safe for birds--their beaks can break them and they can be pointy and sharp when that happens.So the kabobs were a safe, soft toy that would encourage a foraging type of chewing and beaking. The pet store recommended the kabobs. The manager said birds love to chew on them. Well, I almost did not buy one, because they are so plain and boring looking. I did not remember ever having them with our other birds, or even seeing them in the stores when we bought things for our birds years ago. But somehow, a small kabob ended up in the basket and we went ahead and put it in Conner's cage. All the other toys looked so much more colorful and pretty and so the eye tends to want those really pretty things for your bird, right? Well, the kabob is so deceptive--and as inexpensive as they are, you should really consider getting one and trying it on your bird--just to see. Every bird is different, and they will not all like the same things, but my Conner...he loves his kabob!When I first put it in there, he did not really do much with it. But within a few minutes, and that is fast in bird terms for something new in a cage, he attacked that kabob and had one of the discs (do not know what else to call them--they are individual little circular discs, stacked and held together by woody string) and he tore the first disc up really fast. Then, he is worked on it solidly now for about a week. he is pecked into some of the bottom discs a little, but he is managed to completely obliterate the top three discs. He also has managed to peck at the string and untie it, so we had to secure it really tightly to keep him from doing that (he did it several times, and the string is easy to untie--which is good, because it makes it easy to take off the cage when the discs are gone).Also, Conner does not make a really big mess with it either. We have it tied on the side of the cage, where it could potentially make a big mess on the floor, but it does not. I do not know what he does with the crumbles--maybe he eats some? but there are some small crumbles on the bottom of the cage. Even so, it is not a messy toy. He just really likes it. And they are light enough he will pick it up with his birdie hand and shake it, climb on it, and more. For a 'bland-looking' toy, he sure gets a lot of mileage out of it, especially for the price.We will probably make sure, as inexpensive as they are, to always have a kabob in various sizes in the cage for Conner. He just loves it, even more than the bright and colorful toys we got for him. Like I said, for the inexpensive price, it is well worth the cost to give it a try.\", 'Beware: if you are ordering this product for a soccer (proper football) lover, you may not get a soccer ball. I received a red and white pseudo-basketball. The tag said \"soccer ball\" too so the manufacturer is clearly not an athlete/sportsman.At $4, I did not bother returning it, but be forewarned: you may not receive a soccer ball!', 'I have large dogs and two of them just love those. Amazingly they do last a long time. Its still in one piece...', 'It works... Positive feedback!  I have several different premier clickers. Amazon offers books on the training with this method and other styles of clickers. When you get to one of the steps it helps to have this design to sort of hide it.', 'as mentioned in other reviews the hood does not stay up by itself. learn if that is something your pet likes (do they hide under covers or do they prefer to be in shelters). if they do not like being under covers it is going to be hard to convince them this is for them. in addition, the bed kind of sags when the pet gets in, in my opinion making it an even harder sell for the pet.', 'My dogs did love these right off the bat but got tired of them within a couple days.  Even after I put them away for a while and then re-introduced these, my two dogs (60lb shephard/lab mixes) did not feel all too keen on them over time.  They chew through many things like their life depends on it so I purchased these rings due to their durability.  However, the nylabone material hardens and becomes very \"spiky\" that gets caught in my pups\\' teeth when ripped off and punctures my skin when accidentally stepped on.', 'Out dog loves this toy! it is the perfect size for her (she is 18 lbs). Not sure if she is figured out that the ball is attached to the rope but she drags this around the house and keeps her busy for a good amount of time.', 'but it is extremely tiny. I put some in the aquarium to feed my cichlids, but I do not think they could see it. I think my fish are too big for this tiny food. They go after a larger pellet immediately.', 'Made my dogs breath fresh but these were a little too small for even my Shih Tzus & Pekinese - I was scared they would choke on them.  I would recommend the company not making them so small and just sticking with the medium ones.', 'The screw that held the two different post sections together was missing, and seeing as how I did not care to wait for a replacement, my husband rigged it to work. I have two kittens that are 3-4 months. One took to it immediately and loves to put her claws all over it. They were both very mesmerized by the ball for a long while ( which somehow stayed attached despite their tugging). So, you definitely cannot beat the price! It actually seems/feels well made too.', \"The promotional video starts buy the girl saying sit repeatedly while pulling up on the dog's leash. This is what the company considers an obedient dog?\", 'Great sturdy product and very cute. My dog just loves to chew, play and wag this around in her mouth. I would highly recommend this for any small puppy.', 'it is really a great toy. It has an adjustment for the difficulty and it is easy enough to clean. My pup personally LOVES it. If you have got a dog who gets bored when you are away, or a dog who needs constant engagement, this is a great toy to introduce. Just stuff it with their favorite treat and let them have at it.', 'Dog still sheds like crazy but the product smells good. I would not buy it again and I do not recommend it for what it is advertised to do.', 'This is a great toy for the agressive chewers.Just make sure that you discard whenever the edges become frayed.', 'When you blow into the whistle it makes an easily audible sound.  I returned it because I really wanted an unobtrusive and silent whistle to communicate with my working pup.', 'this is cute and it fits on my XXL lab but only because the strap holds it in place. On a smaller dog (60lbs) it might actually fit on the head and the strap is adjustable. I wish the strap were not so bright white but photoshop can fix it ok...', 'This product is of great quality. I like the fact that the bottle does not contain plastic and the fish oil comes from pure waters of Iceland. My dogs love the taste. Their hair looks very nice.', 'Bags do their job well. Glad I bought in bulk, do not have to worry about running out for a while.', 'These look nice and are not too difficult to get into the window seal, but putting the window down and then back up makes them come dislodged.  Disappointing since the main reason I take the dogs on rides is so they can get some air.  I may try to rig them differently and see if they stay.  Will update review upon any success.', \"This toy is one of my Standard Poodle's favorites. She loves Mr. Bill and his mournful, &#34;oh no.&#34;  She likes to carry Bill around and make him talk to her. It is well made and a good toy for SNL lovers.\", 'I have a 50 foot aquarium Python, but some days I just want to change the 20 gallon tank.

from my hand guinea pigs should only eat timothy hay or orchard grass i am very happy that this is available to keep their diet from getting monotonous ', 'i gave this ball to a friend who has a great dane pup and she loves it big dogs need big toys and toys that they cannot destroy in short order are hard to find this is the right size for her and as tough as she is ', 'though this product is well made and attractive it is definitely not small i have a canary who never uses it because it is so big and bulky ', 'dogs love this chew toy its thier favorite there is a squeeker in it also which makes it even better ', 'my gerbil inky loves this cage and i do too but for a few reasons i do not good stuff gerbil loved cagei do not have to clean petting zone often inky does not use it muchwater bottle is easy to get on plus easy for gerbil to reachplenty of extra space to put toys and hideouts ininky loves the wheel and can easily access itproblems poop flew out of wheel when she ran on itshe brought food into the wheel and made an awful rattling noise when she ran on itinky chewed up about inches up the spiral staircase but this was before i bought her chew toys so she does not usually mess with it anymore inky built nests and tunnels all over the bottom level bar space was about inch wide and she made a huge mess of aspen shavings on the floor from kicking it out to burrow only the wheel glows in the dark and it is very faint it is a good cage but i suggest not having the small holes in the wheel as the poop goes everywhere as well as urine and pieces of shredded food ', 'these leashes are very beautifully made i have purchased signature k leashes in the past and discovered another use for them i just purchased a new jeep wrangler and was dismayed to find that when you put the back seat up which is where i keep my dog on long trips there was nothing to secure the seat so that if there was a sudden stop the seat could fall back i tried my dogs k leash to hold it up and it worked perfectly there are little metal rings that are on the top of the actual seat part when folded up i wrapped the leash around the side corner of the top roll bar by pulling the leash through the handle loop of the leash forming a slip knot and attached the lock of the leash to the metal rings on the seat this foot leash works perfectly i purchased for each side of the seat and extra to keep in the car for the dog the leash is easily and quickly unattached by unlocking the leash to put the seats back down the black leather is so attractive and the gold hardware so beautiful that there is no need to take them out or off of the roll bar they just hang down next to the roll bar unnoticed till needed again the leather is strong and survived my dog s teething puppy stage beautiful leash and multi tasking ', 'no one wants pet hair all over their clothes or furniture or bed sheets my cat sleeps with me this works wonders quick reliable easy to remove the hair it picks up and it is inexpensive i have discovered that as it ages the material will crumble but that just means it is time to replace it at the price one or more a year does not make a huge budget impact ', 'two of these pockets each day help the mg tabs of lyseine go into the kitty without the human being torn to shreds thank you ', 'my enthusiastic chewer has barely put a dent in his dinosaur after a month of chewing unfortunately my vet does not recommend this type of toy as it may break his teeth so i will not buy another one luckily it looks like this one will last forever ', 'so what well one kitten is blind she took one step onto the thing and just madly clawed at it started flipping around and army crawling through the center the other cat has severe ch cerebellar hypoplasia he cannot walk and he was thrilled to just jiggle around the outside of it and paw at it i would say if you have a kitten this is a must buy if you have a playful cat this is probably a must buy if you have a lazy and unamused cat this probably will not revive him it is a cat scratcher not a miracle worker ', 'we have a longish haired wriggly puppy who was getting a bit too matted and does not like being combed we ordered this and to be honest i did not expect much but it works like a charm the puppy is now dematted and his coat is so much softer and cleaner it is really wonderful this is incredible value for it is effectiveness and one of the best purchases we made for the dog after combing him with this i then sprinkle some baby powder on him he is got a white coat and brush it out and now he is soft and sweet smelling makes grooming much much easier ', 'i could not resist this toy for my dog mostly because it is so cute but also because of the price i also kind of like the surprise of not knowing what you will get we received a brontosaurus my puppy loves it carries it everywhere and it keeps her from chewing the furniture i would definitely purchase again and certainly recommend it for any chewy puppy parents cannot go wrong with nylabone ', 'i have one cat who can only eat soft food because of teeth problems and this is the only food she consistently eats price is very competitive when you can get it for under can ', 'still best cat litter available the metal scooper is recommended because this stuff really clumps after awhile your plastic one will bend found it cheaper at petsmart and there are off coupons on the manufacturers website you can print', 'my pitbull girl loves the nylanone monster chicken flavor she bears down and applies intense pressure to this nylabone and it stil lasts for about two months it is a great choice at a great price since she decimates even the largest rawhide bones thanks again nylabone my only negative comment is that i wish it was available direct from amazon instead of one of its partners since the shipping is expensive ', 'dog loves to make sounds with this even if we are not playing fetch with ball my dog will actually drop and pick up just to make it squeak and carry it around in her mouth i have the medium and large size for my pound australian labradoodle i believe she likes the medium size best great toy ', 'i orderd these for my indoor pets in case something happens and they get out they came exactly how i wanted them and are so lightweight even the ferrets and rabbit do not notice them ', 'i have a little yorkie who plays with this every morning i put a cup of his food in this and he has so much fun playing and eating highly recommend for anyone with a super energetic pup or someone who wants to prevent their dog from eating their food too fast it is also dishwasher safe ', 'purchased it twice so i could use it on another tank best in the business right here and i would highly recommend to anyone took weeks to cycle a gallon aquarium use as directed and you will be fine ', 'fits great in the back on a bar jeep places for holding stuff great size nice design easily slips in and out for cleaning ', 'shipom male loves his extreme kong it is heavy but he loves it he will destuff it and spend a few minutes chewing on it he does not chew for long just because of the weight of it ', 'my kitty loved these flippers the first few days he seems to get bored with toys when the new wears off but he does still play with them some especially when i hide them under the edge of the area rug i do like these though because he chews on his toys that are not made for chewing but ignores his chew toys these are a nice thick rubbery material so i do not have to worry about him eating them ', 'we waited too long to neuter and i was so upset that i was going to be constantly cleaning the dog beds and scrubbing and disinfecting different areas of my house well feliway made a huge difference we have no peeing in the house and since using the spray that you can get to use in addition to the diffusers we have been able to reintroduce all our dog beds whew this stuff is not cheap but we were amazed at the difference this made i actually think that i will not have to use it forever we are about months post neutering if the good habits continue we will gradually discontinue the spraying of the dog beds and then one by one remove the infusers note after neutering without the spray we tried to reintroduce a dog bed the cat peed on it almost instantly with the spray he does not care a thing about them ', 'my cat loves using combing himself whenever he wants its a must get item for the feline lovers i highly recommend best used of flat or angled corner walls ', 'received promptly and engraving is correct i got the large size and my puppy will grow to lbs we will see how durable it is up date informed company the color came off and they promptly replaced tag without my request for replacement replacement was done within a week of informing them of color loss very impressed thank you']\n"

would like to give this a higher rating because of the ingredients but the waste tarnishes that opinion ', 'i bought this for my cat because he grew out of his old one it is cute and very durable ', 'i replied to another review about these types of toys prior to receiving this skunk giving this brand a very positive review in my reply to another customer s review when the skunk arrived i was shocked at the poor quality of the toy immediately i went to my dog s folder and pulled out the cardboard that had been attached to her fox and her raccoon that is when i realized that this was not the same brand that i had previously purchased her toys are by a company called crazy critters i purchased it at meijers a super grocery store and the cardboard indicates in a red box in the upper right hand corner as seen on tv she loves these toys and has been carrying them around in her mouth for about a year the squeaker in the tail of both was chewed out within a day or two so it may be worth removing the tail squeaker and leaving in the head squeaker looking at the skinneeez i can see how a number of dogs have ingested this toy i did not give the skinneeez to my smooth coat collie and would never recommend giving the skinneeez to any dog the material looks very thin and like it can easily be torn ', 'my ferrets love this stuff only this i tried another salmon oil when i last ran out and they thought it was gross their coats are soft from it and a drop on their belly distracts them for nail clipping hate that the price went up bucks but still worth it ', 'i really like how the dispenser attaches to the leash so i always have a poopsack i bought compostible refills be sure to get the kind that dispense from the bottom ', 'my guinea pigs love love love timothy hay it is

heat is hard on the bunnies we have several bottles for them this one is good because you can fit ice inside and the water stays cooler for the day ', 'dogs go wild for these and they are made in the you s with no soy wheat or other nasty allergens the only thing you might not like is that these are not strips as in the jerky strips that others sell these are compressed little briquettes that you can break apart for tiny training treats ', 'not as good as the cat man doo brand according to my cat he almost knocks me over for those these he eats but i can tell that he does not like them as well as the other brand i will likely go back to that brand even though it cost a bit more ', 'neither of the bottles that i purchased leak and i do not have to refill them more than once a day as long as

this toy even the female who is years old and rarely playful turns into a lioness and loses her mind over this mins of playtime and they are tired for the rest of the night ', 'cats loved it only problem was that they figured out they could stand up and put their head through the top to get any treats on the top level other than that they have figured out how it works and look forward to hearing the sound of my adding food i would keep it at the hardest level since they figure it out pretty quickly and the treats food are gone within minutes ', 'my miniature schnauzer loves this toy this is my second one buying not because it broke because it has gotten so nasty he drags it with him everywhere we have to make him drop this toy the only downside is if you have hardware floors this toy will scratch them so be careful my boxer likes this toy as well but not as much because her teeth are alot smaller i would recommend it for a dog with bigger teeth i have noticed an improvement in his gum strength i have had to brush his teeth less since getting this toy and he loves it i cannot say enough how much my dog loves this toy also while crate training he used to chew his bed but once we got this toy he has not touched his bed if we leave his toy out of his crate his bed is chewed again life saver love nylabone love this dinosaur ', 'these filters fit the fountain i have and seem

pound boxer pit mix is a fan it is no stick or real bone but it seems to be the next best thing he is been chewing on it on and off for a few weeks and has not gotten far which is nice i guess he likes the different textures and shapes but i cannot telepathically talk to the pooch so i just take the chew marks for what they are it does not smell and it does not get slimy weeks of him chewing on it and it is still in great shape so it is lasting a while too ', 'definitey can not go wrong with nylabone can keep your dog busy for hours and are good for their teeth as well reccommend for people who have dogs who are heavy chewers', 'i bought these because my friend told me how much her pups love them that they are much safer than rawhide and last longer they did go over with my dogs however they brought out their prey drive and caused them to be aggressive towards eachother they never actually chewed them they just guarded them two of the dogs attacked each other i guess for getting too close and my other very large dog growled and lunged at us when we got to close we had to coax them away from these the seller was wonderful i called him with my concerns he returned my call right away and sent me a full refund i would absolutely do business again with this company perhaps in the future we can try these again ', 'this product is great especially when you have two cats controls the order which is wonderful will continue to use', 'we usually never have fleas but we do not want to risk it and do not want to spend so much on frontline have not had a flea or tick

It's the perfect travel buddy, too, since it's on the smaller side. She's not the biggest chewer, so that may be why it's lasted so long. I love that there's no stuffing in the body- I wish all dog toys would have an alternative to the stuffing. The toy just got a hole in it a few days ago when her and my new puppy were playing tug with it. No big deal since the $9 was worth the year it lasted. I'm back to get a couple more and hope they last just as long. I give it 4 stars because I wish there was a way to replace the squeaker.Note: I don't think this toy is good for heavy chewers or those who like to thrash toys around, but I don't think any stuffed toys are good for puppies who enjoy those activities.\n",

The cats havent seem to mind the difference in litter and just hopped right in.I have a very sensitive nose and really hated having thecats indoor  because of the smell  (no matter how often I clean there is always that ammonia smell), but this litter really made a huge difference...it doesnt even bother me now when I am cleaning it except now I have stopped cleaning everyother day to ever couple days, cause its easy to forget because I don't smell it and I have to peek in the boxes to see how its looking.\n",

They really like having elevated feeding bowls.  Its construction is sturdy and it looks easy to clean (it hasn't gotten dirty yet).  I was worried that the bowls might be cheap, but they are made of sturdy steel.  I also like that you have the option of not using the legs and snapping them under the bowls.  The only sacrifice there is there is nothing below the bowls to catch water.  Not a big deal unless you are putting this onto a hardwood floor.  Also this is not really for a small dog like a Yorkie even though they label it \"small.\"  My dogs are over 30 pounds, which I consider medium, and the bowl is at a perfect height for them.  But I suppose dogs that size don't really need a raised bowl anyway.  All in all I would recommend this product.\n",
